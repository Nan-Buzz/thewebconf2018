        <p><small>During a disaster event, it is essential to know
        about needs and availabilities of different types of
        resources, for coordinating relief operations.
        Microblogging sites are frequently used for aiding
        post-disaster relief operations, and there have been prior
        attempts to identify tweets that inform about resource
        needs and availabilities (termed as need-tweets and
        availability-tweets respectively). However, there has not
        been much attempt to effectively utilise such tweets. We
        introduce the problem of automatically matching need-tweets
        with appropriate availability-tweets, which is practically
        important for coordination of post-disaster relief
        operations. We also experiment with several methodologies
        for automatically matching need-tweets and
        availability-tweets.</small></p>

      </header>
      <p>In a disaster situation (e.g., earthquake, flood), two
      types of information that are especially useful for
      coordinating relief operations are <em>what resources are
      needed</em> and <em>what resources are available</em> in the
      affected region&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]. Microblogging sites like Twitter are
      very useful for gathering situational information during
      disasters&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. Hence, it is a natural quest to
      obtain information about post-disaster needs and
      availabilities of resources from microblogs. Specifically,
      two types of tweets (microblogs) are useful:</p>
      <p><strong>(i)&nbsp;Need-tweets</strong>, which inform about
      the need or requirement of specific resources, e.g., food,
      water, medical aid, shelter, and</p>
      <p><strong>(ii)&nbsp;Availability-tweets</strong>, which
      inform about the availability of resources in the affected
      region, or potential availability i.e. resources being
      transported to the region.</p>

      <p>For helping the relief operations, the first challenge is
      to extract need-tweets and availability-tweets from among the
      thousands of tweets posted during a disaster situation, most
      of which contain conversational content. This problem of
      identifying need-tweets and availability-tweets was addressed
      in our prior works&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]. However, to our knowledge, apart
      from identification, there has not been much attempt to
      effectively utilise such tweets for post-disaster relief
      operations. In this work, we take the first step towards this
      goal, by automatically <em>matching</em> resource needs with
      appropriate availabilities. We assume that a set of
      need-tweets and a set of availability-tweets have already
      been identified from a given (large) set of tweets, and we
      focus on the matching of the identified need-tweets with the
      availability-tweets.</p>
      <p>The actual problem of matching resource needs and
      availabilities is a complex one, which should consider
      several factors like the specific resource which is needed /
      available, the time at which it is needed / available, the
      specific geographical location of the need / availability,
      and so on. In this work, we address a simplified version of
      the matching problem – we assume that an availability-tweet
      matches a need-tweet if and only if they inform about the
      need and availability of the same resource. Note that even
      this simplified version of the matching problem can be
      challenging. For instance, Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
      "#tab1">1</a> shows some examples of need-tweets and matching
      availability-tweets, from one of the datasets used in this
      work. While some pairs might be easier to match since they
      state exactly the same resource (e.g., ‘water’ or ‘medical
      supplies’), some pairs are much more difficult to match
      because they use different terms to refer to the same
      resource (e.g., need of ‘shelter’ and availability of
      ‘tents’, as shown in Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
      "#tab1">1</a>).</p>
      <p>We experiment with several methodologies for matching
      need-tweets and availability-tweets, ranging from simple noun
      overlap to methods using word embeddings. Though the methods
      achieve some success, it becomes evident that the problem of
      matching needs and availabilities needs to be explored
      further in future.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">2</span> Methodologies
          for matching needs and availabilties</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>For a particular need-tweet, we identify a list of
      matching availability-tweets, ranked in decreasing order of
      how closely they match the need-tweet. We use several
      methodologies for such matching.</p>
      <p><strong>(1) Matching based on common nouns:</strong> We
      use a part-of-speech tagger on need-tweets and
      availability-tweets to identify the <em>nouns</em>, since
      nouns are likely to indicate the specific resources that are
      needed / available. To check the match of an
      availability-tweet with a need-tweet, we compute the fraction
      of the nouns in the need-tweet that are also contained in the
      availability-tweet. For a given need-tweet,
      availability-tweets are ranked in the decreasing order of the
      fraction of common nouns (ties resolved arbitrarily).</p>
      <p><strong>(2) Matching based on local word
      embeddings:</strong>Here we train Word2vec&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] on the set
      of tweets from where the need-tweets and availability-tweets
      have been identified. We construct a tweet-vector for each
      tweet, by averaging the Word2vec term-vectors of the terms
      contained in the tweet. The match between an
      availability-tweet and a need-tweet is given by the
      <em>cosine similarity of their tweet-vectors</em>. For a
      given need-tweet, availability-tweets are ranked in the
      decreasing order of this cosine similarity value.</p>
      <p><strong>(3) Matching based on pre-trained word
      embeddings:</strong>A limitation of methodology (2) is that a
      large set of tweets about the current event is needed to
      learn the local word embeddings. At times of a disaster, it
      might be necessary to start matching needs and availabilities
      even before a sizeable number of tweets about the current
      event have been collected. To this end, we explore the use of
      three types of pre-trained embeddings.</p>
      <p>(3a) <em>Pre-trained GloVe embeddings&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]</em>, which are
      pre-trained on two billion tweets from the Twitter 1% random
      sample&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>].</p>
      <p>(3b) <em>Pre-trained embeddings for detecting paraphrases
      in tweets&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]</em>: These embeddings are designed
      to detect paraphrases in tweets, i.e., tweets which are
      lexically different but semantically similar&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. Hence,
      these embeddings are likely to identify needs and
      availabilities that might be written differently, but have
      similar semantics.</p>
      <p>(3c) <em>Word2vec embeddings pre-trained over tweets
      related to several disaster or crisis events&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]</em>, which
      can be expected to capture well the semantics of terms used
      during disaster events.</p>
      <p>For all the pre-trained embeddings, we follow a matching
      methodology similar to (2), where we compute a tweet-vector
      for each tweet, and then compute the cosine similarity
      between the tweet-vectors of need-tweets and
      availability-tweets.</p>

          Results</h2>

      </header>
      <p><strong>Datasets:</strong>We used the Twitter API to
      collect English tweets related to two disaster events –
      (i)&nbsp;50,018 tweets posted after the 2015 Nepal
      earthquake, and and (ii)&nbsp;70,487 tweets posted after the
      2016 earthquake in Italy. We refer to the datasets as
      <em>nepal-quake</em> and <em>italy-quake</em> respectively.
      We then used three human annotators to identify need-tweets
      and availability-tweets. For the nepal-quake dataset, they
      found 499 need-tweets and 1333 availability-tweets; for the
      italy-quake dataset, 177 need-tweets and 233
      availability-tweets were found. Details of the datasets can
      be found in our prior works&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>].</p>
      <p><strong>Evaluation measures:</strong>For a given
      need-tweet, each methodology produces a ranked list of
      availability-tweets, evaluated as follows.</p>
      <p>(i) <em>Precision of matching:</em>For each need-tweet, we
      used each methodology to retrieve 5 top-matching
      availability-tweets. We then asked the human annotators to
      check each need-availability pair, and judge whether the
      match is correct. There was very high agreement between all
      the annotators; majority voting was considered in the few
      cases where there was no unanimous agreement. The precision
      of a matching methodology is the fraction of pairs that are
      matched correctly by the methodology. In Information
      Retrieval terminology, we are computing
      <em>Precision@5.</em></p>
      <p>(ii) <em>Recall of matching:</em>The recall of a
      methodology is the fraction of all need-tweets for which the
      methodology is able to identify at least one correct matching
      (based on the judgement of the annotators).</p>
      <p><strong>Evaluation results:</strong> Table&nbsp;<a class=
      "tbl" href="#tab2">2</a> compares the performance of the
      various methodologies for the two datasets. We see that the
      methodology based on noun overlap performs reasonably well;
      in fact, this method performs the best for the italy-quake
      dataset. Pre-trained word embeddings, including embeddings
      trained on crises-related tweets, perform worse than the noun
      overlap methodology for both datasets, probably because a new
      event is associated with a very different vocabulary than
      prior events (on which the models are pre-trained). The
      methodology using local Word2vec embeddings (trained on the
      tweets of the current event) performs the best for
      nepal-quake dataset, but worse than the common noun overlap
      method for the italy-quake dataset. We will investigate the
      causes for this difference in performances in future.</p>

      <p>We introduced the problem of matching post-disaster
      resource needs and availabilities from microblogs, which is
      important for effective coordination of post-disaster relief
      operations. We found that, even for a simplified version of
      the problem, more effective methods are necessary, especially
      for tackling the varied vocabulary of different disaster
      events. We plan to study more realistic versions of the
      matching problem in future.</p>
