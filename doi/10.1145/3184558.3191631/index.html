      <div class="abstract">
        <p><small>With an increasing number of consumers using
        social media platforms to share both their satisfaction and
        displeasure about the products and services they use every
        day, organisations with a customer service focus are
        recognising the importance of rapid – and genuine – online
        engagement with their customers. In turn, consumers
        increasingly judge organisations on the quality of customer
        service and degree of responsiveness to online queries.
        This paper presents an extensible framework for evaluating
        direct engagements of customer service teams with customers
        on Twitter. Furthermore, this framework provides the
        capability to measure and analyse indirect engagement with
        industry sector rivals, especially their patterns,
        frequency and intensity. By applying graph analysis to
        these Twitter interactions, our framework generates various
        analytical measures and visual representations, exemplified
        through a case study based on seven major UK telecoms
        companies. With a dataset consisting of 15,000 tweets and
        3,500 user profiles, the results provide sustained evidence
        for indirect engagements between business rivals, with
        customer queries acting as a trigger for intense
        competition between companies based in the same industry
        sub-domain.</small></p>

      <p>The online news and social networking service Twitter has
      become one of the most popular social platforms for a variety
      of demographics across the world. It provides a rich,
      constantly updating, corpus of big social data to study a
      range of complex socio-cultural issues, from life event
      detection&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] and identifying multilingual
      communities&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>], through to sentiment
      classification&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] and providing deeper insight into
      personality and behaviour&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. Unsurprisingly, Twitter is
      increasingly being used by organisations to communicate with
      their customers, due to the fast and convenient medium of
      engagement&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>], using a variety of sophisticated
      human and automated approaches&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>]. In 2016, a survey was
      carried out on 5,450 people who follow small or medium-sized
      enterprises (SME) on Twitter&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]; the key results show
      that 83% of people that received a reply felt better about
      the SME, and 68.7% have made at least one purchase from an
      SME because of Twitter.</p>
      <p>The medium can thus serve as an indicator to underlying
      issues of performance, management and even strategic
      matters&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]; in many instances, the majority of
      complaints deal with product and service-related
      issues&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>].
      Many studies have been conducted to explore aspects of
      customer services experiences in various business domains,
      such as travel and telecoms&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>]. News agencies are not
      far from social media analysis, using it to uncover users’
      interests so they can provide more focused
      contents&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. While various domains have long
      applied network analysis techniques – such as for crime
      detection and prevention&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>] – only recently has work has been
      conducted to see how users relate to brands via network
      structures&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>], how information shared by companies
      disseminate and their types&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>], and what type of
      engagements from companies was found to be of effect on
      customers perception of the brand&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>]. A common approach in
      conducting such studies has been to use sentiment analysis,
      mainly to measure consumer's perception and
      satisfaction&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>].</p>
      <p>However, the novel framework presented here aims to
      provide quantitative insights that can produce a more
      holistic view of customer service Twitter accounts and their
      interactions. Rather than focusing on individual posts and
      their sentiment, the framework helps in identifying complaint
      conversations that can be exploited by other business rivals,
      to be interrogated further by analysts or decision makers.
      With the high volume of activity on Twitter, the framework
      focuses on detecting possible key issues by using the
      connected component feature of graph to identify problematic
      conversations for further analysis. Furthermore, by using
      streaming and RESTful data, this approach can be applied to
      live data to catch problematic conversations before they
      reach certain thresholds.</p>

          Telecoms Sector</h2>

      </header>
      <p>Most UK households have access to both fixed broadband and
      a smartphone, with consumers moving seamlessly between fixed
      and mobile connections. This has been driven by the growing
      take-up of superfast broadband services, with the proportion
      of UK households with fixed broadband increasing to 82% in
      2017, with telecoms services rising to 3.8% of total
      household spend. With the increasing convergence of mobile
      and Wi-Fi connectivity, many customers in the UK have
      switched from pay-as-you-go tariffs to pay-monthly tariffs in
      2016, and nearly two-thirds of mobile connections were
      4G-enabled at the end of 2016. Consumers are also using these
      networks more – average data use per fixed line residential
      broadband connection increased by 36% year on year to 132GB
      in June 2016, and average data use per mobile connection
      increased by 44% to 1.3GB&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>]. The UK telecoms sector has
      continued to grow rapidly over the past five years, with
      total sector revenues in 2016 of £35.6bn, including mobile
      retail revenues of £15.3bn&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>].</p>
      <p>There are four main fixed broadband network operators in
      the UK: BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media; alongside the
      incumbent BT, alternative providers compete in the retail
      provision of fixed services (including telephony and
      broadband), as well as other operators using a variety of
      wholesale inputs purchased from BT and resellers. There are
      currently four main mobile network operators (MNOs) in the UK
      (with 2017 subscriber numbers): BT/EE (29.8m), O2/Telefònica
      (25m), Vodafone (17.6m), and Three/H3G (12.01m); there are
      also several mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs),
      including Virgin Mobile (via EE, 3m), giffgaff (via O2,
      420,000) and Sky Mobile (via O2, 335,000)&nbsp;[<a class=

          Methodology</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The dataset contains tweets and related replies for seven
      well-known UK telecoms companies: BT, EE<a class="fn" href=
      "#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, giffgaff, O2, Sky,
      Virgin Media and Vodafone. The choices were intended to
      represent companies of various sizes, history and range of
      services provided. While a few companies only had one account
      on Twitter, some of them have multiple accounts alongside the
      primary Twitter account; in those instances, the dedicated
      customer services accounts were indicated in the biography of
      the company's other accounts. Therefore, as the focus of the
      study is on customer services on Twitter, data were collected
      from either the company's primary account or its dedicated
      customer services one (N.B. names throughout the paper will
      refer to Twitter account handles rather than official company
      trading names).</p>
      <p>Inspired by the approach taken by Cogan et
      al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>],
      this study consists of two main steps: the data collection
      phases and the graph construction. The data collection phase
      runs iteratively to obtain reply chains, process them and
      store them in a database. Once the data collection phase is
      completed, a large graph that includes all reply nodes and
      edges is constructed to conduct the initial analysis. The
      NetworkX Python package&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] was used for the graph construction,
      while Gephi&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] provided a range of tools for
      visualisation.</p>

        <p>To ensure we were able to collect as much data as
        possible, the data collection comprised of three steps.
        First, a stream endpoint is opened to catch activities of
        accounts under investigation, those accounts will be
        referred to as ‘CS’ (customer service) accounts. The
        Twitter Streaming API<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id=
        "foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> is designed to return tweets
        created by the user, their retweets, replies directed to
        their tweets, and retweets of their tweets. However, the
        stream does not include tweets mentioning the user, and
        replies/retweets by protected users.</p>

      <section id="sec-9">

          <div class="title-info">
            <h3><span class="section-number">3.2</span> Reply
            Chains</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Returned statuses from the Streaming API may represent
        reply-to statuses that have not been collected previously.
        It was found that most missing statuses were either posted
        before the data collection started, were mentions, or that
        the user account is protected. This issue could have a
        significant impact on the quality of the analysis;
        therefore, once statuses are returned from the stream
        endpoint, their type is checked first (tweet, retweet,
        etc). If status is a reply, the ID of the status to which
        it was replying is extracted from
        <em>in_reply_to_status_id</em>. Then, using the extracted
        ID, we check if the replied-to status has already been
        collected and present in the dataset or not. If not, the
        REST API is then used to collect them. This process runs
        recursively for newly-collected replies until no further
        replies are available. Unavailable statuses are often
        results from either deletion or protected accounts.</p>
        <p>An analysis of changes on the graph after the second
        phase of data collection shows that there were increases in
        the number of nodes and edges by 43% and 62%, respectively.
        This increase in connections has resulted in merging 176
        conversations into others, which improved connectivity of
        the graph and, thus, the accuracy of the dependent
        analyses.</p>

        <p>The main data structure of conversations on Twitter
        suggests status-to-status <a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
        "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> relatioship. In graph concept,
        statuses represent nodes that are linked by directed edges.
        Therefore, the study follows a graph construction approach
        in conducting analysis and produces three graphs. First,
        <em>base</em> graph is constructed to capture structure of
        the dataset, i.e. stuatus-to-status. Then, from the base
        graph, it generates two graphs; <em>Users</em> graph to
        examine the user-to-user direct engagements, and
        <em>Coexistence</em> graph to uncover and examine indirect
        engagements amongst rivals.</p>
        <section id="sec-11">
          <p><em>3.3.1 Base Graph.</em> Once the data are
          collected, a base graph is generated containing all
          replies and all related information. Nodes represent
          status IDs, while edges indicate replying direction;
          other information is added as attributes to nodes. The
          information used in this study are <em>screen_name</em>
          of the user, <em>timestamp</em> of the reply,
          <em>text</em>, and <em>CS</em>. The additional
          <em>CS</em> value is a binary digit set to distinguish
          accounts – it is set to 1 if the status belongs to one of
          the CS accounts, otherwise it is 0. This value is
          required to eliminate the need for user checks in
          forthcoming analyses. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
          "#fig1">1</a> illustrates the conceptual base graph. As a
          reply can be directed to only one other status, no edge
          is expected to have weight value other than 1, and no
          reply status can have outdegree greater than 1. Nodes
          with 0 outdegree can be either a root node, or it is
          directed to unavailable statuses. On the other hand,
          indegree in this graph indicates the number of replies
          directed to the status node; hence, 0 indegree
          distinguishes leaf nodes. Special case nodes are those
          with indegree and outdegree equal to 0; these are
          isolated/floating nodes and must be removed before we
          perform the analysis – these nodes do not benefit the
          analysis as they are not part of a conversation.
          Furthermore, they will be seen as connected component by
          themselves, which impacts upon the accuracy of
          results.</p>

          <p><em>3.3.2 Users’ Graph.</em> Because most of the
          analysis focus on relationships between reply posts, they
          were applied on the base graph. Nevertheless, to allow
          examination of the relationships between users, another
          graph is generated from the base graph. This process is
          carried out by iterating through edges linking reply
          posts, extracting users’ information, and constructing
          users graph accordingly. In the context of this study,
          only two attributes are used: screen names and ‘CS’
          values. While nodes represent screen names, ‘CS’ values
          are attached to nodes as attribute. For edges, their
          weights indicate number of replies sent from origin node
          (sender) to target node (receiver); therefore, the user
          graph is directed. Applying this process on the example
          in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> results
          in the users graph in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=

          <p>To examine relationships between users, five network
          graph properties are measured. There were no special case
          nodes or edges in this graph, as observed in the base
          graph. For edges, their orientation indicate direction of
          replies, while weight reflects number of replies on the
          edge. Node indegree reflect number of users that have
          sent reply to the node, and outdegree indicates the
          number of users that have received reply from the node.
          Also, weighted measure of indegree and outdegree indicate
          total received and sent replies, respectively.</p>

          <p><em>3.3.3 Connected Components.</em> Reply
          conversations in the base graph are not interconnected,
          which implies that the graph actually consists of many
          subgraphs, or ‘connected components’. Since nodes include
          screen names, those components can be linked to CS
          accounts. Then, they are used to measure the size of
          conversation, their depths, and to identify shared
          conversations between the CS accounts. In the base graph,
          the number of connected components reflect the number of
          conversations. Therefore, in the base graph many
          components should be expected, depending on activity of
          the CS accounts and their audience.</p>
          <p>To find conversations for a specific CS account, the
          search run through all components; in each component, the
          process iterates through nodes and examine the
          <em>name</em> attribute. Once a match is found, the
          search process stops and the identified component is
          either analysed on the fly, or returned for further
          analysis. Additionally, some of those components will be
          used to construct the coexistence graph, as covered

          <p><em>3.3.4 Coexistence Graph.</em> As mentioned
          previously, this graph aims to measure the indirect
          engagements amongst the CS accounts. Therefore, all
          components in the base graph are processed in turn to
          find which CS accounts appeared. For each component, name
          attributes for nodes with CS value equal to 1 are
          extracted. If more than one CS account was found, those
          accounts are used to created nodes and edges for the
          coexistence graph. Thus, nodes are generated from CS
          names, and edges indicate common conversation between
          linked nodes. Subsequently, if the edge already exists,
          its weight is increased. For an illustration of this
          process, see Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=

        interestingly, <em>@skyhelpteam</em> was found to have an

        in the base graph cannot have a weight greater than one,
        edge weight in the users graph includes all replies from
        one user to another. Therefore, the number of nodes and
        edges in the users graph is lower that those in the base

        <p>Properties of the users graph are presented below in

        show that <em>@virginmedia</em> received that highest
        number of replies from 866 users with an average of 3.05
        per user. Also, the same account scored highest in the
        number of recipients. The difference between indegrees and
        outdegrees shows that apart from <em>@o2</em>, all accounts
        have outdegrees bigger that their indegrees. Additionally,
        the total number of sent replies is found to be more than

            Conversation Components</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>As discussed in the methodology, each connected
        component in the base graph represent a conversation
        component that includes related replies. In this dataset,
        there were 3,289 conversation components with various
        number of replies. Observations of their sizes shows that
        the smallest component consists of one post, while the
        largest component contains 81 posts. The number of one-post
        components was 102, and they were all found to belong to CS
        accounts. Examining those singular components revealed that
        they were either original tweets that have not received
        replies, or replies to unavailable statuses. As covered
        earlier, unavailable replies are those that could not be
        captured due to a deletion or the posting account being
        protected. Because they do not have any length, and hence
        do not represent conversation, single-node components have
        been excluded from forthcoming analyses.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the majority components were found to have
        two nodes. Those components were 1,188 and the orientation
        of their edge's direction suggest that most of these
        communications were from CS accounts and directed to
        customer's post. However, 25 of those conversations were
        initiated by customers. As they are two-node components, it
        seems that those posts have not been answered by the
        relevant CS account. Although other means of communications
        could have been used, such as direct messages, there were
        no visible sign of further interaction.</p>

        </header>
        <p>It is important to note that the size of connected
        components does not necessarily reflect length of
        conversations, although there is a strong correlation
        between size of component and length of its longest path
        (0.88). As can be seen in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig5">5</a>, many components measures are positioned in a
        near-perfect diagonal line; interestingly, the longest path
        in the biggest component (81 nodes/posts) was only 1.</p>

        <p>To illustrate properties of connected components, the
        largest 20 components were chosen for visualisation, as
        shown in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>. The
        findings show that components with very high variations in
        indegree amongst their nodes mostly originate from CS
        accounts. An example of this claim is illustrated by the
        three big components in the figure; when observed, they
        were found to featuring advertising tweets that had
        received too many replies from Twitter users. For example,
        the root node in the biggest component was a post by
        <em>@o2</em> that has indegree of 80, and all connected
        nodes have indegree of zero, i.e. they were not answered.
        On the other hand, the longest path component was ranked
        the third biggest component. It was found with a single
        leaf, and all other nodes along the path were found with
        indegree=1 and outdegree=1, forming what we call a
        <em>simple chain</em>, uniquely coloured in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>.
        Additionally, 15 of those components were found to have
        originated from customer accounts, and they all take a
        semi-simple chain as they feature some branches.</p>

        <p>Generally, simple chains can be identified where the
        number of edges equals length of the longest path in
        component. Simple chains account for 80% of the connected
        components in graph, of which 47% were found with the
        length of 1. This is in agreement with the results of
        connected component sizes presented earlier. Finally,

        <p>As covered eariler, connected components in the base
        graph represent individual conversations. Therefore, those
        components were utilised to uncover indirect engagement
        amongst CS accounts. As reply nodes in the base graph
        include screen name of user, it is possible to identify
        those components featuring more than one CS account. For
        each connected component, names in reply nodes are checked
        if they belong to CS account or public. Components with
        more than one distinct CS name are then marked as common
        component. The results show that there were 39 common
        components in total; 38 include two CS accounts, and one
        includes three accounts. The graph presented in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a> shows those
        components, with each CS account given a colour code for
        identification as the legend clarifies.</p>
        <figure id="fig7">
          <img src=
          "../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191631/images/www18companion-370-fig7.jpg"

        <p></p>
        <p>To explore these relationships further, coexistence
        graph was constructed, as clarified in
        Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-10">3.3</a>. Edges
        in this graph are undirected and their weights indicate
        frequency of CS accounts appearing in same conversation.
        The resulted graph is shown in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig"
        href="#fig8">8</a>, where node size is proportional to its
        degree to indicate how many other CS accounts the node has
        coexisted with, while darkness of node reflects weighted
        degree to show the total frequency of coexistence for the
        node.</p>
        <p>The first observation on the graph is that
        <em>@giffgaff</em> account was not found in any common
        conversation. In contrast, <em>@o2</em> was the only
        account that have shared conversations with all other CS
        accounts, while <em>@vodafoneukhelp</em> was found with the
        least common conversations. Nevertheless, weighted degree
        measure shows that <em>@virginmedia</em> was the highest in
        number of common conversations; 21 components, although its
        degree tells that those conversations were shared with only
        three other CS teams. The heaviest edge existed between
        <em>@virginmedia</em> and <em>@btcare</em>, followed by the
        edge between <em>@virginmedia</em> and
        <em>@skyhelpteam</em>. Also, edges of <em>@o2</em> show
        that it mostly appeared with <em>@ee</em>, and for
        <em>@vodafoneukhelp</em> it was <em>@ee</em>.</p>
        <p>Additional observation on the coexistence graph provides
        insight into uncovering more specific service areas within
        the specific industry or sector. This was clear when the
        modularity of the graph was examined&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]; the result has unfolded
        into two communities, as shown in Figure&nbsp;<a class=
        "fig" href="#fig9">9</a>. Also, industry knowledge
        regarding the following CS teams: <em>@ee</em>,
        <em>@o2</em>, and <em>@vodafoneukhelp</em> belong to a
        domain that is mostly focused on mobile services, while
        <em>@skyhelpteam</em>, <em>@virginmedia</em>, and
        <em>@btcare</em> are mostly known to be focusing on
        landline and home internet services.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, using a similar approach that was used in
        Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-16">4.1</a>, the
        delay was measured in those components to evaluate if
        presence of competitor has influence on how quick CS team
        response. Interestingly, improvement in delays of 26%, 43%
        and 72% were observed for
        <em>virginmedia</em>,<em>btcare</em> and
        <em>skyhelpteam</em>, respectively. These improvements in
        delays, in addition to the frequency of common
        conversations for those companies, confirm the existence of
        online competition amongst them.</p>

      <p>Initially, the performance of CS accounts and their
      popularity on Twitter were measured by an analysis of
      activity and users. From this perspective,
      <em>@virginmedia</em> was found to have the highest volume of
      posts, the least diverse in terms of type of posts (99.7%
      were replies) and with the highest number of customers
      served. The average delays of accounts ranged between 1.14
      and 3.34 hours, apart from <em>@skyhelpteam</em> which was
      found with an average delay of 45.04 hours. This may indicate
      a management issue for the team, such as unclear social media
      strategy or staff resources.</p>
      <p>Most CS teams have clearly specified working hours on
      their account page, apart from <em>@giffgaff</em> and
      <em>@o2</em>. Interestingly, these two accounts were found to
      have the lowest delay. Nevertheless, high availability, i.e.
      longer activity hours, was not found to significantly improve
      speed of reply to customers. For example, while
      <em>@giffgaff</em> was observed active for longer periods,
      <em>@o2</em> was generally found to be faster to reply.</p>
      <p>Although the data shows that no CS team has been in a
      direct engagement with a competitor, analysis of
      common/shared connected components has uncovered some form of
      competition amongst CS accounts. Particularly, in the case of
      <em>@virginmedia</em> and <em>@btcare</em>, the competition
      was clear and intense. In all cases, customers were found to
      be initiators of competing conversations by making use of the
      Twitter <em>@-mention</em> feature to bring different rivals
      into conversations. In contrast to phone, letter or email,
      complaints that are made on social media are open for the
      public to read and follow, and can be potentially
      reputationally damaging if not handled appropriately.
      Therefore, it was not surprising to see improvement in the
      speed of response in a few instances where competitors were
      included in the same conversation. This shows that with the
      openness of social media platforms, such as Twitter,
      customers may have more chance to obtain better deals or
      speedy resolution of their problems&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>]. In turn, this approach of
      publicly-posting complaints add pressure onto CS teams to
      improve their social media engagement, especially when
      business rivals are included by customers&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>].</p>
      <p>Some of these issues are particularly pertinent for the
      mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) – such as Virgin
      Mobile, giffgaff and Sky Mobie – who use the infrastructure
      of the main mobile network operators (MNOs), as presented in
      Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-6">2</a>. While this
      may not directly affect CS operations, especially as many
      customers are unlikely to be aware of whether their company
      owns any underlying network infrastructure, it may have
      operational and/or performance impacts on the virtual
      operators depending on their service-level agreements with
      the infrastructure operators.</p>

          Conclusions</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The paper has introduced an extensible framework for
      evaluating customer service performance and competition
      between industry rivals on Twitter. We have presented methods
      on how network graph properties can be used to make
      increasingly sophisticated evaluations, with the framework
      being tested on selected operators in the competitive UK
      telecoms sector.</p>
      <p>Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-7">3</a>
      highlighted two important techniques that need to be applied
      prior to starting the analysis phase. First, the recursive
      reply chain data collection is vital to obtain accurate
      results. The importance of this stage stems from the fact
      that it fills the gaps and improve the connectivity of
      graphs. Second, construction of the initial graph from
      replies and the removal of floating isolated nodes. In
      constructing this graph, key information needs to be
      identified and attached as attributes to nodes. The
      information used in this study include post <em>id</em>,
      <em>timestamp</em>, <em>screen_name</em>, <em>text</em> and
      <em>CS</em> value. However, the framework could easily be
      extended to include other information, such as retweets.</p>
      <p>A wider aim of this project is to show the importance of
      connected components in distinguishing users’ conversations,
      as well as analysing competitions and their key features.
      With the added value of modularity classes, competition
      analysis has helped in uncovering more specialist communities
      within the industry sector.</p>
      <p>The presented framework could also be used by service
      providers to reflectively evaluate their social media
      accounts and interactions, as well as to generate insight
      into the activities of their key domain competitors; in this
      way, the presented methods in this study could be used to
      make real-time observations. Another application would be to
      identify gaps, competitions, challenges and opportunities in
      services that can be used in developing strategies for
      start-ups, for example. The approach could also be applied to
      other domains or contexts, such as non-profits, charities or
      the public sector. Also, it can be used for groups of users,
      such as celebrities and their direct and indirect engagements
      on Twitter. Moreover, with the emerging practice of signing a
      reply with a team member's initials, this practice can be
      exploited to further augment this framework's capabilities;
      for example, this extension could help in estimating team
      sizes, working shifts and to evaluate performance of
      individual team members.</p>
