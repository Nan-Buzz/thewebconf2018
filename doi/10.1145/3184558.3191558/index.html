However, the task of travel itinerary recommendation and planning is tedious and challenging for tourists, who are often unfamiliar with the various Points-of-Interest (POIs) in a city. Apart from identifying popular POIs, the tourist needs to construct a travel itinerary comprising a subset of these POIs, and to order these POIs as a sequence of visits that can be completed within his/her available touring time. For a more realistic itinerary, the tourist also has to account for travelling time between POIs and visiting times at individual POIs. Furthermore, this itinerary should incorporate tourist preferences such as desired starting and ending POIs (e.g., POIs that are near the tourist&#x0027;s hotel) and a subset of must-see POIs (e.g., popular POIs that a tourist must visit). We term this the <SmallCap>TourMustSee</SmallCap> problem, which is based on a variant of the Orienteering problem. Following which, we propose the <SmallCap>LP+M</SmallCap> algorithm for solving the <SmallCap>TourMustSee</SmallCap> problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Using a Flickr dataset of POI visits in seven touristic cities, we compare <SmallCap>LP+M</SmallCap> against various ILP-based baselines, and the results show that <SmallCap>LP+M</SmallCap> recommends better travel itineraries in terms of POI popularity, total POIs visited, total touring time utilized and must-visit POI(s) inclusion.</small>     </p>    </div>    <div class="CCSconcepts">     <p> <small> <span style="font-weight:bold;">CCS Concepts:</span> &#x2022;<strong> Information systems </strong>&#x2192; <strong>Personalization;</strong> <strong>Recommender systems;</strong> <em>Location based services;</em> <em>Data mining;</em> Web applications;</small> </p>    </div>    <div class="classifications">     <div class="author">     <span style="font-weight:bold;">      <small>Keywords:</small>     </span>     <span class="keyword">      <small>Tour Recommendations; Trip Planning; Recommendation Systems</small>     </span>     </div>     <br/>     <div class="AcmReferenceFormat">     <p>      <small>       <span style="font-weight:bold;">ACM Reference Format:</span>       <br/>       Kendall Taylor, Kwan Hui Lim, and Jeffrey Chan. 2018.

One main contributing factor is that the choice of Points-of-Interest (POIs) to visit in a city is often large, and varied. In addition, users often have limited time for touring, hence any recommended tour is also constrained by time, mainly for the consideration of travelling times between POIs and adequate POI visit durations. Furthermore, it is desirable that the distance and travel time between POIs should be reduced so as to allow the number of POIs and/or visitation time to be maximised. The desirability to include must-see POIs is often high on the user&#x0027;s agenda as there are often major attractions which are consisted essential to visit, (such as the &#x201C;Buda Castle&#x201D; in Budapest or Toronto&#x0027;s Royal Ontario Museum).</p>    <p>In our work, recommended itineraries consist of a start and end point linked together by a path connecting a selection of POIs, including all or a subset of must-see POIs determined by the user. A POI can only be visited once, and the tour must include at least one POI other than the starting or ending POI. Links connecting POIs are associated with a travel time cost, which when summed, constrains the tour duration to a user-specified time budget. This constraint also ensures that only a subset of available POIs can be visited for a single itinerary. In order to represent user preference for particular types of POIs, each POI has a value representing its utility/score to the user. A <em>good</em> proposed itinerary is therefore one with a maximal sum of POI utility/score value but that can be completed within the allotted time budget. Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> shows an example of this problem. <figure id="fig1">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191558/images/www18companion-297-fig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 1"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span>      <span class="figure-title">       <strong>Example graph where vertices represent POIs (with a utility score <em>s<sub>i</sub>        </em>), and edges the time to travel between them (<em>t</em>        <sub>        <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>        </sub>)</strong>.

Itinerary recommendation has its origins in the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and its many variants typically used in the field of Operations Research. Of particular note are the TSP variants known as the Selective TSP&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>], TSP with Profits&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>], or the Orienteering Problem&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>]. The main objective of these works are to plan for an itinerary comprising a set of POIs with the highest profit for a general tourist, while the Orienteering Problem has additional constraints of a specific starting and ending point. Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulations for this problem are widely used and have been successfully implemented to provide optimal solutions&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>]. The focus of these works are on the optimality of their approaches and their evaluation involves synthetic datasets where the optimal solutions are known.</p>    <p>     <strong>Itinerary Recommendation using Social Media</strong>. In recent years, researchers have merged the works in Operations Research with the use of social media for itinerary recommendation&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>]. Most of these works are formulated as ILPs based on either Orienteering Problem or TSP variants but instead of using synthetic datasets, these works evaluate their approaches using social media, such as Flickr geo-tagged photos that reflect real-life POI-based itineraries for several cities around the world. Similarly, there have been many applications for tour itinerary planning and recommendation&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>] that utilizes social media and techniques similar to these discussed works. The focus of such works is on recommending itineraries that are popular and reflect the real-life itineraries taken by these social media users.</p>    <p>     <strong>Top-k POI Recommendation</strong>. The field of top-k POI recommendation is also closely related to tour itinerary recommendation and we discuss key works in this research area&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>]. In these works, the main aim is to recommend a set of <em>k</em> POIs, where these POIs are ranked based on their relevance to a user. Such works typically utilize approaches based on various adaptations of matrix factorization or collaborative filtering algorithm. Similarly, there have been applications&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] developed to recommend a list of individual POIs, which are not structured as an itinerary. The focus of these works are more on the relevance of individual POIs to users, rather than recommending an itinerary of connected POIs with the various user constraints.</p>    <p>     <strong>Itinerary Recommendation with Mandatory POIs</strong>. The use of a set of POIs that must be visited is a further extension to the itinerary recommendation problem and has been explicitly addressed in only a few papers. Gendreau et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], presented a branch-and-cut algorithm formulated as an ILP and tested against several heuristics. <em>Compulsory vertices</em> were incorporated into the model comprising a subset of total vertices which must be visited for a successful tour. Conclusions focused on the success of solving problems with a larger number of vertices rather than the impact of compulsory vertices.</p>    <p>Must-see (or &#x201D;specified nodes&#x201D;) were incorporated in the the model used in an early paper by Laporte et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. This work used a branch-and-bound algorithm to find optimal tours where specified nodes were to be visited <em>exactly once</em>. Again the focus of the work was not the effect of compulsory nodes but the computational effort required for sub-tour elimination. Later work by Li et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>] presents an approach for the constrained orienteering model with compulsory nodes, however the formulation of the problem is based on network flow theory and differs markedly from that used here.</p>    <p>     <strong>Main Differences with Our Work</strong>. While these earlier works offer interesting insights into the itinerary recommendation problem, our work differs from them in the following ways: (i) the works on <em>Operations Research</em> focus on the optimality of their solutions, typically utilizes synthetic datasets and do not consider must-visit POIs, while our work uses real-life POI itineraries mined from a Flickr geo-tagged photo dataset and consider must-visit POIs; (ii) the works on <em>Itinerary Recommendation using Social Media</em> utilizes a real-life dataset but does not consider must-visit POIs in their problem formulation, whereas our work considers this additional constraint; (iii) the works on <em>Top-k POI Recommendation</em> focus on recommending a ranked list of individual POIs, whereas our work requires the recommendation of relevant POIs, and additionally the planning of an itinerary through these POIs with a specific starting and ending POI that can be completed within a certain time; and (iv) the works on <em>Itinerary Recommendation with Mandatory POIs</em>, like works on <em>Operations Research</em>, is focused on solution optimality and uses synthetic datasets where the profit are randomly generated, while our work uses a real-life dataset where the POI profit reflect the popularity of POIs based on their number of visits. In addition, our formulation of the must-visit POIs allows for the flexibility to recommend itineraries that include a subset of must-visit POIs, instead of having to include all POIs like the earlier works.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-6">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">3</span> Background and Problem</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>In this section, we present some basic definitions used in our work and formulate the <SmallCap>TourMustSee</SmallCap> problem.</p>    <section id="sec-7">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">3.1</span> Problem definition</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>Our proposed <SmallCap>TourMustSee</SmallCap> problem of recommending an itinerary with must-see POIs is NP-hard&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. The complexity of <SmallCap>TourMustSee</SmallCap> is exponential as the set of POIs grow and the problem becomes intractable using a &#x201C;brute-force&#x201D; approach. This problem is similar to the <em>Travelling Salesman Problem with Profits</em> and the <em>Orienteering Problem</em>, where the objective is to maximise a total <em>score</em> (accumulated from visiting POIs), while keeping travel time between POIs under a fixed budget. The recommended itinerary begins at a specified starting POI and terminates at another.</p>     <p>This problem can be represented as a graph <em>G</em> = &#x27E8;<em>V</em>, <em>E</em>&#x27E9; where <em>N</em> = |<em>V</em>| and <em>V</em> = {<em>v</em>     <sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>v<sub>N</sub>     </em>} the set of vertices (or POIs), and <em>E</em> is the set of connecting edges. Each edge connecting vertex <em>i</em> to <em>j</em> has a travel time cost and is known for all <em>v</em> &#x2208; <em>V</em> and can be represented as <em>t</em>     <sub>      <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>     </sub>. The total time budget for the tour is <em>T<sub>max</sub>     </em> which limits the number of vertices in a tour. Each vertex also has a non-negative known score <em>S<sub>i</sub>     </em> for all <em>v<sub>i</sub>     </em> &#x2208; <em>V</em> where <em>i</em> &#x2208; {1, ..., <em>N</em>}.</p>     <p>We define an itinerary as a path between distinct starting and ending POIs, containing at least one other POI, where POIs are visited only once and sub-tours are excluded. Let <em>P</em> be a set of POIs with <em>p</em>     <sub>1</sub> as the starting POI and <em>p<sub>N</sub>     </em> the destination POI, an itinerary <em>I</em> is a sequence of connected POIs such that <em>I</em> = {<em>p</em>     <sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>p<sub>N</sub>     </em>}. We introduce a set <em>M</em> of <em>must-see</em> POIs where <em>M</em> = {<em>m</em>     <sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>m<sub>L</sub>     </em>}&#x2009;where&#x2009;<em>L</em> &#x2264; <em>N</em>, ideally <em>L</em> is much smaller than <em>N</em>.

However, eliminating sub-tours before optimizing the model is exponential in complexity. A common method used to remove sub-tours while avoiding excessive computation cost is the MTZ&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>] approach, which we utilize in this work. This method examines an initially generated tour <em>t</em> for sub-tours and adds a constraint to the model for each sub-tour found. The model is then re-evaluated with the new constraints producing a new tour <em>t</em>&#x2032; which is again evaluated for sub-tours. The iteration continues until a solution is found without sub-tours.<br/></li>     </ol>    </section>    <section id="sec-9">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">3.3</span> Must-see POI(s) constraint</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>In addition to the constraints above, we introduce a constraint that ensures a set of must-see POIs are visited in a successful solution.

POIs</strong>. Whether a recommended itinerary includes the set of must-see POIs.<br/></li>     <li id="list14" label="(2)"><strong>Tour Profit</strong>. The total profit from all POIs in a recommended itinerary.<br/></li>     <li id="list15" label="(3)"><strong>POIs Visited</strong>. The number of unique POIs in a recommended itinerary.<br/></li>     <li id="list16" label="(4)"><strong>Utilized Budget</strong>. The total budget utilized for a recommended itinerary, i.e., the total cost needed to travel between POIs and visit durations at POIs.<br/></li>     </ol>     <p>Metric 1 allows us to determine if the recommended tour itineraries fulfilled the constraint of visiting the entire set of must-see POIs (or at least one of the must-see POIs). Metrics 2 and 3 measure the total profit and number of visited POI in a recommended tour, which reflect the perceived utility value to a tourist, i.e., a tour with higher profit and more POIs is better. Metric 4 examines the total time budget used for a tour itinerary and a preferred tour is one that utilizes more time for visiting POI compared to travelling between POIs.

As must-see POIs are included as a constraint on the model, it is not surprising that neither LP+M, MaxM nor GreedyM could find solutions for all tours combinations.</p>     <p>Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab4">4</a> presents the number of successful tours found with LP+M, MaxM and GreedyM, along with the sizes of the must-see POI set.

Interestingly, Toronto experienced a lower success rate for nearly all set sizes compared with the other cities even though it had the second highest number of POIs to select from.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-17">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">5.2</span> Profit of Recommended Tours</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>The inclusion of the constraint to visit all must-see POIs reduces average tour profit, and is illustrated in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> where average profit values are lower than the optimum for the LP+M, MaxM and GreedyM algorithms. Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> presents average profits and standard error <em>including</em> failed tours and clearly displays the retarding effects of must-see POIs.</p>     <p>The results on the average profit of tour itineraries confirm the superior performance that LP+M has over the MaxM and GreedyM algorithms. LP+M consistently recommends tour itineraries with greater profitability and a higher POI visitation rate than GreedyM, and found greater numbers of successful solutions than MaxM. As expected, the average profits decline with both approaches as the must-see set increases in size. However, regardless of the size of must-see POIs set, LP+M offers the best performance in terms of tour profit, followed by MaxM and then GreedyM.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-18">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">5.3</span> Total POIs in Recommended Tours</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>As shown in Table&#x00A0;<a class="tbl" href="#tab5">5</a>, the average number of total POIs visited for each algorithm&#x0027;s tours tends to decline from the optimum as the must-see set increases.

The GreedyM algorithm produced tours with a POI count that was on average lower than that for LP+M and MaxM. This result indicates sub-optimal performance of GreedyM, compared to LP+M and MaxM.</p>     <p>Compared to GreedyM and MaxM, LP+M consistently recommends tour itineraries with the most number of POIs for the same number of must-see POI.

This result is not surprising given that GreedyM does not optimise the tour as a whole, but rather does it in two parts leading to inefficiencies.</p>     <p>The inclusion of must-see POIs as a model constraint when generating travel itineraries results in tours with lower profitability and higher travel times compared to those without must-see POIs. The extent of this reduced performance increases markedly as the size of the must-see set increases. Further, the likelihood of failing to generate a valid itinerary increases substantially as more must-see POIs are included in the tour. Interestingly though, there is a high chance (around 30%) that a single must-see POI may be visited by an algorithm which ignores the must-see set when optimising.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-20">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">5.5</span> Discussion</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>These results show the general good performance of our proposed LP+M algorithm over the GreedyM and MaxM baselines, while the LP algorithm was included to demonstrate an optimal solution that does not consider must-see POIs. Compared to LP, GreedyM and MaxM, our proposed LP+M algorithm is able to recommend the highest number of successful tour itineraries, i.e., those that include the must-see POIs. In addition, our LP+M algorithm is able to consistently recommend tour itineraries that comprises a higher number of POIs and a higher total tour profit, compared to the GreedyM and MaxM baselines, thus resulting in tour itineraries that are more satisfying for tourists based on these measures. The LP+M algorithm also utilizes the available time budget more efficiently than the GreedyM baselines, as it schedules tour itineraries with more time allocated to visiting POIs than travelling between POIs. Based on these evaluation metrics, experimental results show that LP+M is the overall best performing algorithm, followed by MaxM then GreedyM.</p>    </section>   </section>   <section id="sec-21">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">6</span> Conclusion and Future Work</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>In this work, we have proposed and formulated the <SmallCap>TourMustSee</SmallCap> problem, which incorporated a set of must-see POIs into travel itineraries, along with considerations of a starting/ending POIs and travel times between POIs and visit durations at POIs. We then solved this <SmallCap>TourMustSee</SmallCap> problem as an Integer Linear Program, and we denote this approach as the <SmallCap>LP+M</SmallCap> algorithm. Compared with various baselines, LP+M performed consistently better with higher average profits, a greater average number of visited POIs, and a higher POI visit duration. Our algorithm incorporates both travel time and POI visit durations and incorporates real-world data gathered from publicly accessible sources. Using a well established ILP model as the base for LP+M also ensures a robust and efficient optimisation strategy which produces consistent results.</p>    <p>This work fills a gap in existing research by providing a specific analysis of must-see POIs and their impact on optimal itineraries. Future work would include further evaluation with a more diverse range of alternate heuristics to validate this research, and to repeat the experiment on more cities and POI sets. Nonetheless, it is clear through our evaluations that LP+M successfully and effectively incorporates must-see POIs into optimised itineraries and out-performs various baselines. In future, we intend to extend this work to recommend tour itineraries that span multiple days and regions, and consider additional aspects such as weather, accommodation, restaurants and POI admission fees.</p>    <p>     <strong>Acknowledgments.</strong> Kwan Hui Lim is supported by a Defence Science and Technology Group Postdoctoral Fellowship.
