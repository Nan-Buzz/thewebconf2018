        <p><small>Although consumer behavior in response to search
        engine marketing has been studied extensively, few efforts
        have been made to understand how consumers search and
        respond to ads post purchase. Advertising to existing
        customers the same way as to prospective customers
        inevitably leads to wasteful and inefficient marketing.
        Employing a unique dataset that combines both search query
        and purchase data, we examine consumers’ searching behavior
        and response to search engine marketing after purchase. We
        study large advertising campaigns for two popular
        technology products. We find that over half of the branded
        keyword searches come from consumers who already purchased
        the products, and that advertising response varies based on
        whether searchers are pre- or post-purchase. In general,
        post-purchase searchers are less likely to click on focal
        brand ads (i.e., they are less responsive to ads for
        products they already own). However, post-purchase
        searchers are still responsive to advertising and much more
        likely to click on ads for complementary products (i.e.,
        they are more responsive to ads for relevant products other
        than the focal product).</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In the last 20 years, search engine marketing has grown
      epidemically. Since the advent of sponsored search
      advertising, sponsored ads have accounted for a majority of
      online advertising expenditure. It is estimated that over
      half of Google's revenue in 2016 came from sponsored ads
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>]. It is
      generally accepted that search engine marketing is more
      targeted than other means of digital advertising because
      consumers have just shown interest in a particular product
      (by searching for it), thus limiting “wasted expenditure” on
      potential consumers who have not explicitly shown interest
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>].</p>
      <p>Still, some waste is expected as advertisers try to
      attract consumers very early in the conversion funnel, which
      describes the journey as consumers navigate online sites,
      from the first step of awareness of a product to a final
      purchase decision [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. The idea is that at the top of the
      funnel, there are many options; at the bottom of the funnel,
      there are fewer, more specific options narrowed down for
      potential purchase by the consumer. Advertisers often bid on
      a variety of keywords, including branded keywords (those
      related to the focal brand) and generic keywords (those
      related to the general product category) [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>]. It is widely accepted
      that consumers in early stages of the conversion funnel will
      search for generic keywords while consumers closer to making
      a purchase will search for a specific focal brand [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>].
      Researchers have already suggested that consumers make
      different queries and respond differently to ads depending on
      their purchase funnel stage [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>].</p>
      <p>For example, consumers who search for generic keywords
      such as “computers” are likely to be at the consideration or
      awareness stage while consumers who search for “Lenovo
      computers” are assumed to be at the consideration stage and
      closer to making a purchase. Consequently, advertisers of the
      focal brand (in this example, Lenovo) would typically pay
      more attention to consumers searching for “Lenovo computers”
      and tend to bid heavily on focal branded keywords. Thus, on
      average, branded keywords are priced higher than generic ones
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>],
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>].</p>
      <p>The two examples of sponsored search ads in Figure
      <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> illustrate how strategies
      that advertise to post-purchase searchers the same way as to
      pre-purchase searchers are flawed. The first example is one
      author searching for “Lenovo T460” on Bing.com from a Lenovo
      T460 computer. Bing presents an ad attempting to sell another
      T460 computer. The second example is an author searching for
      Windows 10 on Google from a computer with Windows 10
      installed. In both examples, the advertisers treat the
      searcher as of they are very close to making a purchase when
      in reality they are not. These examples indicate that this
      underlying assumption may lead advertisers to waste their
      budgets by showing customers products they already own. In
      this study, we argue that by ignoring post-purchase search,
      online advertisers do not achieve full efficiency with a
      large portion of their branded searches. A better
      understanding of consumers’ post-purchase information-seeking
      behavior can help companies strategically plan and provide
      consumer services, which will improve consumer satisfaction,
      and likely revenue, in the long run.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>In fairness to prior work, which has focused exclusively
      on pre-purchase search, it is very difficult to acquire both
      search and purchase data in the same place. However,
      solutions to exclude lists of users now exist (e.g., a list
      of existing customers). Beginning in 2017, Bing, Google, and
      Facebook launched new functions that advertisers can use to
      distinguish consumers who have converted from those who have
      not. While the data labels on whether someone is an existing
      customer are still noisy, advertising differently to
      customers is now possible. Still, these companies give little
      advice on what to do with the data: Should advertisers
      continue to market the same way? Should they not market at
      all? Or should they advertise complementary products when
      possible?</p>
      <p>Our study aims to answer these questions by examining
      consumers’ post-purchase searches on the Bing search engine.
      In general, post-purchase searchers are less likely to click
      on focal brand ads–they are less responsive to ads for
      products they already own. However, post-purchase searchers
      are much more likely to click on ads for complementary
      products–they are more responsive to ads for relevant
      products other than the focal product. From the perspective
      of the search engine, they are also more likely to click on
      the search results page when an ad is shown. We contribute to
      the literature by empirically investigating consumers’ needs
      after purchase and discussing how to strategically advertise
      to post-purchase searchers. Our findings also bear important
      practical implications to sponsored search advertisers and
      search engine designers.</p>

      <p>Our work is positioned at the intersection of two
      literatures in which there is extensive work: information
      seeking and sponsored search advertising. Due to space
      constraints, we hyperfocus this literature review on work
      related to identifying search intent and ad response in
      relation to the <em>conversion funnel</em>. While there has
      been significant work exploring how people search at various
      points in the conversion funnel <em>pre purchase</em>, we
      have found that prior research has completely ignored the
      fact that consumers both seek information and are exposed to
      sponsored search ads <em>post purchase</em>.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Early work on online consumers in the purchase context
        found that people have different goals when surfing the
        web. Over time these goals have been translated to search
        intent. An early study by Broder [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] found that there are
        mainly three types of search intent, which correspond to
        three types of search queries: informational, navigational,
        and transaction-related queries. Moe [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>] examined browsing data
        to identify a typology of consumers’ store visits. Four
        types of store-visit goals were identified: buying,
        browsing, searching, and knowledge building. The author
        found that browsing alone accounts for around 60% of
        visits, searching for around 30%, and buying for around 7%.
        The most relevant aspect of this work to our study is that
        the authors found heterogeneity in purchase intent
        depending on the context. Consumers with different goals
        demonstrate various likelihoods to purchase and respond
        differently to various marketing messages.</p>
        <p>This early study was followed by a growing body of
        literature classifying consumers’ search intents. Jansen,
        Booth and Spink [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>] and Kathuria, Jansen, Hafernik and
        Spink [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>] found that the majority of search
        queries are informational, although there are substantial
        navigational queries.</p>
        <p>Another growing body of literature is focused on
        combining queries with consumer click-stream behavior to
        automatically identify consumers’ search intents [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>],
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>],
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href=

        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]. Various methods such as k-means
        clustering and supervised vector machine have been employed
        for automatic identification and prediction of intent.
        Jansen and Schuster [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] further integrated traditional
        conversion funnel theory into the classification of search
        queries and found distinct differences in involvement
        between stages; consumers show various levels of interest
        in a product depending on their funnel stage identified by
        a predictive model. Recent work has found that consumers
        also have multiple search intents, even within a single
        search query. Gonzales-Caro and Baeza-Yates [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] and Kathuria et al.
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>] found
        that queries are likely to be multifaceted.</p>

        </header>
        <p>With sponsored search advertising gaining in popularity
        among marketers, early academic work focused on quantifying
        the benefit of using sponsored search advertising in terms
        of ROI, compared to other traditional marketing channels. A
        comprehensive study by Ghose and Yang [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] empirically analyzed the
        relationship between search engine query metrics such as
        page position, click-through rates, and conversion profits.
        Chan, Wu, and Xie [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] examined the overall lifetime value
        of consumers acquired from online and offline conversion
        channels and found that consumers acquired from sponsored
        search ads have higher transaction rates and long-term
        value, accounting for spillover effects. However, it has
        been argued that sponsored search ads are likely to be
        over-credited under the last-click attribution model
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>].</p>
        <p>As sponsored search ads gain more recognition among
        marketers, researchers are shifting their focus and
        analyzing one or two aspects of either the platform (what
        is being shown to users), advertisers’ bid strategies, or
        different outcomes to identify recommended best practices
        for advertisers. Sponsored search ads often interact with
        other aspects of the search results page. Yang and Ghose
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>]
        investigated the dependence between sponsored search ads
        and organic search results, and their findings suggest that
        appearance in organic search results can enhance the
        effectiveness of sponsored search advertising. Other
        studies have focused on branded keywords. Rutz, Trusov, and
        Bucklin [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>] found that consumers who search
        branded or vague keywords are more likely to revisit a
        store. Using a large-scale field experiment, Blake, Nosko,
        and Tadelis [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] found that branded keyword ads have
        very small to no short-term returns. When a company stops
        advertising, consumers who search for its branded keywords
        use organic listings to find the information they need.
        Contrary to common belief, the return for sponsored search
        advertising is, on average, negative [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]. Simonov, Nosko, and Rao
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"

        investigated the primary value of branded keyword ads and
        found that when a company stops advertising for its focal
        brand keyword, some users are likely to be stolen by its
        competitors. Thus, brand keyword ads should be used
        primarily to defend existing market shares.</p>

        <p>We filter the search queries by branded keywords (i.e.,
        queries that include the terms “Windows 10” or “Xbox One”).
        We employ not only filtered search queries but also search
        engine results (ad links and organic links), clicks on the
        results page, and dwell time on the page. The main reason
        we focus on branded queries is because they include
        well-balanced searches from both pre- and post-purchase
        users.</p>
        <p>We focus on two products for this study: Windows 10 and
        Xbox One. The data we collect to describe the differences
        in overall <em>search intent</em> includes Bing searches
        for Windows 10 during its launch campaign from July to
        October 2015 and searches for Xbox during November and
        December 2016. The data we collect for analyzing
        <em>sponsored search ad response</em> is from April to June
        2017. We use more recent data for the advertising analysis
        because we rely on random flight data<a class="fn" href=
        "#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> that are stored for
        only the most recent months.</p>
        <p>Since the focal product ad link is usually the most
        relevant to a focal brand search (e.g., when someone
        searches for Xbox One S, the most relevant link is likely
        the ad link to the Microsoft store, which sells Xbox), it
        is hard to determine with the current Bing algorithm, which
        shows the same thing to everyone, what would happen if a
        non-focal ad is shown or if no ads are shown (in other
        wordsm we have no counterfactuals). However, there is a
        small random flight on Bing that randomly selects which and
        how many ads are shown for a very small percentage of
        search traffic. The random flight data enable us to ask
        questions about how users will respond when they are shown
        non-focal brand products. We can also use these data to
        restrict results to cases when only one ad is shown.</p>
        <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> is a bar chart
        of the ads shown for the specific query “Windows 10” for
        both <em>regular</em> and <em>random flights</em>. It shows
        that the large majority of users see the same one ad with
        the regular flights — an ad for Windows 10 (plot for Xbox
        omitted due to space constraints). However, for the random
        flights, the ads shown to searchers are distributed over
        many more ad links. This variation due to experimentation
        allows us to answer questions regarding which types of ads
        are more impactful for post-purchase searchers. These
        random flights allow us to set up our data as if it came
        from an experiment. It is important to note that Bing ads
        for Windows 10 and Xbox One products do not differentiate
        searchers based on the device used or other sales-related
        information.</p>

        <p>For Windows 10, to identify whether a search was made
        pre- or post-purchase, we label searches from Windows 10
        devices as post-purchase searches. For Xbox, we rely on
        anonymous Microsoft product sales data. If a consumer
        searched before activating the product, we categorize the
        search as pre-purchase. If a consumer searched after
        activating the product, we categorize the search as
        post-purchase.</p>
        <p>We find that over half of the searches with a keyword
        containing the focal brand name are from users who have
        already purchased (52% in the case of the first nine weeks
        of the Windows 10 launch and 68% in the case of the Xbox

      season of 2016. We investigate how pre- and post-purchase
      searchers differ in their search intents and then look at how
      they differ in what they click on and click-through rates. We
      then focus on answering our research question, namely “What
      should an advertiser advertise to existing customers?” We
      rely on response to sponsored search advertising for just the
      focal brands (the exact search “Windows 10” and the exact
      search “Xbox One”), utilizing the random flight data, which
      includes ad impressions for both the focal brand ads and
      relevant but non-focal brand ads.</p>

          <p><em>4.1.1 Windows10.</em> At the beginning of the
          launch of the Windows 10 campaign, most searches for
          Windows 10 came from users who had not upgraded; however,
          as the campaign progressed, the proportion of searches
          from Windows 10 users quickly rose, and a majority of
          searches for Windows 10 came from existing customers. In
          addition, the number of overall searches quickly declined
          one month after the product launch, showing that interest
          in a product quickly declines after people have been made
          aware of it via a product launch. For Windows 10, we
          analyze searches containing “Windows 10” during the
          product launch campaign from July to October 2015. Figure
          <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> plots the linear
          standardized number of searches containing “Windows 10”
          across the first few months after the product launch. The
          orange represents post-purchase searches. While
          pre-purchase searches are mainly focused on “Windows 10”
          and “upgrade”, post-purchase searches are focused more on
          troubleshooting Windows 10.</p>

          <p>Within top search queries (i.e., conditional on
          searching for the exact same thing), post-purchase
          searchers are less likely to click on ads compared to
          pre-purchase searchers. One explanation for this is that
          most ads are tailored to pre-purchase searchers so it is
          likely that post-purchase searchers do not find the ads
          useful or helpful. Figure <a class="fig" href=
          "#fig4">4</a> plots ad click-through rates for each
          search query for pre- and post-searches. To make this
          metric comparable between searches, we focus on cases
          where searchers see only two ads. The queries here are
          all top search queries based on number of searches. The
          orange represents post-purchase searches. Similar
          analyses were repeated for other products, and the

          <p><em>4.1.2 Xbox.</em> Similar to Windows 10, people
          search for different topics about Xbox, pre and post
          purchase. This section discusses findings for searches
          that contain “Xbox” from November to December 2016. Also
          similar to Windows 10, post-purchase searchers are more
          likely to search for troubleshooting information. Current
          Xbox customers’ click-through rates are consistently
          lower, whether from existing customer-dominated queries
          (like those searching for help) or non-customer-dominated
          queries, than pre-purchase searchers. This further
          confirms our observation from Figure <a class="fig" href=
          "#fig4">4</a> that post-purchase searchers are less
          likely to click on ads compared to pre-purchase
          searchers. Similar to Figure <a class="fig" href=
          "#fig4">4</a>, Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a>
          plots ad click-through rates for each search query,
          conditional on searchers seeing two ads. For Xbox, we
          also examine the dynamics of the search. For each
          consumer who purchased an Xbox during the last week of
          November or first week of December 2016, we analyze how
          they searched before and after the purchase. From Figure
          <a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>, we plot the number of
          consumers who searched and the relative date to purchase.
          As can be seen, consumers made the most searches one day
          before purchase and then continued to search after
          purchase. A long tail in search can be observed after
          purchase. To further understand pre- and post-purchase
          search behavior, we examine how many consumers searched
          only before or only after purchase. The results are
          reported in Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a>.
          Interestingly, in our data, only 12% of consumers
          searched both before and after purchase; the majority of
          consumers searched only after purchase.</p>

          <p><em>4.2.1 Overall.</em> In this section, we analyze
          how searchers respond differently to ads for all selected
          queries by examining two metrics: click-through rate and
          dwell time on the search engine results page. These
          metrics have been widely used in the information
          retrieval literature to measure how satisfied searchers
          are with search engine results. In our analysis, we
          constrain searches to those in which searchers see
          exactly two ads at the top of the search engine results
          page. Our analysis compares how pre- and post-purchase
          searches differ in these two metrics, conditional on
          searching for the same query and seeing the same ads
          during the same time period. We focus our analysis on

          <p>Results for both Windows 10 and Xbox suggest that
          post-purchase searchers spend less time examining the ads
          on search engine results pages and are less likely to
          click on ads compared to pre-purchase searchers.
          Accordingly, the difference in click-through rates and
          dwell time on the search engine results page suggests
          that current product users quickly move on to other
          information on the results page when they find the ads do
          not meet their needs.</p>
          <p>When searchers do not find ads useful, they are likely
          to use organic results to meet their needs. We compare
          the click-through rates and dwell times for organic
          results between pre- and post-purchase searches,
          conditional on searching for the same query and seeing
          the same organic and ad results in the same time period.
          Table reports the statistics and test results. On
          average, current product users spend more time looking at
          and are more likely to click on organic search results
          compared to non-users. Thus, post-purchase searchers are
          more likely to be satisfied with organic results.</p>

          <p>The findings from previous sections indicate that
          post-purchase searches are made to fulfill needs distinct
          from those that motivate pre-purchase searches. In this
          section, relying on the variation in ads shown from the
          random flights, we investigate which type of ad does a
          better job of satisfying post-purchase searchers’ needs.
          We focus on two search queries: “Windows 10” and “Xbox
          One” using data from Bing ads in 2017. For Windows 10, 30
          days of data was collected during May 2017. For Xbox, 60
          days of data was collected from April to June 2017.
          During the period we observe, ads for Windows 10 and Xbox
          varied due to competition and advertisers’ strategic
          bidding behavior. This provides the variation in
          advertisement that we need to identify which types of ads
          better satisfy post-purchase search needs. It is possible
          that this variation is subject to certain advertising
          bias but according to current Bing ad bidding rules,
          advertisers (i.e., Dell or Microsoft) cannot distinguish
          between pre- and post-purchase searchers. Thus, this
          variation equally influences both pre- and post-purchase
          searches. To control for unobserved bias, we add controls
          for demographics and geographic location, which are the
          two most frequently used factors by ads to segment
          searchers. Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a> shows
          model-free evidence that these groups of users respond
          differently to different types of ads. We see that
          existing users are less likely to click on ads in the
          regular flights but more likely to click on ads in the
          random flights, which include many more complementary
          products. To demonstrate this difference more formally,
          we label the ads and also run a regression to quantify
          the size of the effect of showing complementary ads
          versus focal brand ads to pre- versus post-purchase
          searchers.</p>
          <p>Our analysis includes two types of sponsored search
          ads: ads related to the focal brand and non focal brand
          ads. We use several rules to determine whether an
          advertisement is a focal brand ad. For Windows 10, we
          categorize advertisements that meet any of the following
          rules as non focal brand ads: mentions <em>driver
          update</em>, <em>reviews</em>, <em>system repair</em>,
          <em>fixing errors</em>, or <em>anti-virus</em> in the
          advertisement message.</p>
          <p>For Xbox, we categorize advertisements that meet any
          of the following rules as non focal brand ads: mentions
          <em>xbox live</em>, <em>xbox</em>, <em>gold</em>,
          <em>video game</em>, <em>controller</em>, <em>hard
          drive</em>, <em>headset</em>, or any other obvious
          accessories in the advertisement message.</p>
          <p>We first investigate whether ads should be shown in
          the results for post-purchase searches by comparing cases
          where only one advertisement is shown to cases where
          users do not see an advertisement. We model whether a
          user clicks on anything on the results page, including
          both organic results and sponsored search ads, as a
          binary choice as a function of search type (i.e., pre- or
          post-purchase) and whether an advertisement is shown (at
          all). We then investigate, conditional on showing an ad,
          what kind of ads would work best for these searches. We
          focus on cases where only one ad is shown on the results
          page. To answer these two questions, we use the following
          two models for estimation:</p>

          10. As we can see from Table <a class="tbl" href=
          "#tab4">4</a>, only a small portion of searches are shown
          focal brand ads for Windows 10. This is understandable
          given that Windows 10 was released about two years ago.
          On average, post-purchase searches are more likely to be
          shown focal brand ads. This validates that advertisers
          cannot distinguish between pre-purchase searches and
          post-purchase searches. As can be seen, post-purchase
          searches also have lower click-through rates for
          advertisements.</p>

          <p>The first column of Table <a class="tbl" href=
          "#tab6">6</a> presents the estimation results regarding
          whether post-purchase searches should be shown ads. The
          negative coefficients for post-purchase search indicate
          that, on average, post-purchase searchers are less likely
          to click on anything on the results page, including both
          organic results and ads. However, the positive
          coefficient for the interaction between user type (post
          purchase or not) and advertisement type (focal brand or
          not) indicates that showing ads to post-purchase searches
          can improve the overall click-through rate on results
          pages. The second and third columns answer the question
          of what types of ads should be shown to post-purchase
          searchers. The negative coefficient for post-purchase
          confirms our finding in previous sections: post-purchase
          searchers have lower advertisement click-through rates.
          The positive, though not significant, coefficient for
          “NonFocalBrand” suggests that searchers are more likely
          to click on ads when they are for a non focal brand (or
          complementary product). The positive coefficient for the
          interaction term indicates that post-purchase searchers
          are more likely to click when the ad is not a focal brand
          ad. The difference between Model 2 and Model 3 is that in
          Model 3, we add controls for major domains such as
          Amazon, Best Buy, and Microsoft. These domain effects
          absorb some effects from the interaction term. The third
          column of Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab6">6</a> also
          adds demographics such as gender and geographic location.
          In Model 3, while the coefficient for interaction is
          still positive, it is not significant. Tables <a class=
          "tbl" href="#tab5">5</a> and <a class="tbl" href=
          "#tab7">7</a> present similar descriptive analyses and
          estimation results for data on searches for Xbox. Xbox
          estimation results are similar in direction and, in
          addition, all results are significant.</p>
          <p>Our estimation results suggest that from a search
          engine perspective, post-purchase searchers should be
          shown ads. From an advertiser's perspective, non focal
          brand ads best serve post-purchase searchers’ needs based
          on the click-through rate. This result corresponds to the
          widely recognized heterogeneity in advertisement effects
          [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
          "popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. For experienced consumers (those
          who know the brand well), ads should mainly focus on
          brand image building while for non-experienced users, ads
          should be informative.</p>

      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that
      combines sales data and search data to examine post-purchase
      searches. The results of this paper are unsurprising ex-post:
      (1) for many core branded keywords, more than half of
      searchers own the product, and (2) post-purchase searchers
      are responsive to advertisements, but (3) they should be
      shown advertisements tailored to post-purchase needs such as
      those for complementary products. However, the unique data
      required this study was unfeasible until now, and the actions
      of key stakeholders such as advertisers and search engine
      designers imply that the results were not obvious prior to
      our research. The volume and intents of searches in the days
      after purchase are not obvious to advertisers, whose
      advertisements are tailored to prospective consumers. The
      newly available functionality to target or exclude tracked,
      post-purchase searchers is largely marketed as a way to
      exclude current owners from targeted campaigns. However, as
      the group of current users is both very large and susceptible
      to the right advertisements, this suggests that advertising
      platforms are unaware of the number of post-purchase
      searchers and the possibilities to reach them. We expect our
      findings to inspire more researchers, both in academic and
      industry settings, to focus on improving advertisement
      efficiency, maximize revenue for search engines, and increase
      search engine users’ welfare.</p>
      <p>Our research extends to several other product spaces
      (withheld from this study due to space constraints),
      including online media (Hulu, Netflix), online services
      (Ancestry, Natch), and automobiles (Ford, Toyota). The
      results from these areas largely validate the present study.
      We consistently see high percentages of post-purchase
      searches made for branded keywords. We also always see
      significant differences in what users click on, conditional
      on being post purchase. However, at this time, the
      randomization in advertisements required to conduct studies
      that are as in-depth as the one we present here is not
      available for all products. It is possible that for some
      products and services, post-purchase searches have higher ads
      click through rate because current users are likely to use
      the ads link for navigation purposes, which supports the
      findings in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>].
      Here we acknowledge that pre and post-purchase searches have
      different needs and behaviour, but the pattern of the
      difference is contingent on the type of products, services or
      even advertisement message that we show to them.</p>
      <p>If anything, our results underestimate the quantity of
      post-purchase searchers, which creates a downward bias
      regarding the impact of our results. Errors in identifying
      post-purchase searchers are almost entirely false negatives.
      While it is rare for our procedures to identify a searcher
      who owns a product when they do not own it in actuality, it
      is common to miss off-line purchases or purchases made in an
      unidentified online setting. Thus, many searches identified
      as pre-purchase are actually post-purchase, somewhat mooting
      the differences between the two sets of searchers. This will
      likely be the case for any practical use of advertising
      platforms moving forward, so we accept this as a limitation
      of both the study and its real-world analog.</p>
      <p>This is frightening research for search engines, as it
      could result in the recommendation to not advertise to
      searchers post-purchase, which would be devastating to
      revenue. Our study suggests that that is not the case, but we
      feel that it is critical to explore the work further because
      post-purchase search comprises a huge portion of a large
      industry. We look forward to extending the research into
      advertising revenue to better understand the implications for
      advertising platforms of separating out pre- and
      post-purchase searches.</p>
      <p>This is exciting research for advertisers seeking to
      formulate an efficient strategy, as it is possible to
      identify post-purchase searchers within a query. There has
      been insufficient academic research on how advertisers should
      use these functions or whether they should use them at all.
      Our results can help advertisers strategically plan their
      advertisement budget. We look forward to extending the
      research into customer conversation and return costs to
      better capture the trade-offs of adverting to post-purchase
      searchers.</p>
      <p>This is also meaningful research for searchers who may be
      frustrated by the post-purchase search experience. Search
      advertising is geared towards pre-purchase, with an emphasis
      on the initial purchase of units. Post-purchase needs are
      more varied, ranging from complementary items to product
      help. This makes both advertising and organic linkage
      difficult. We hope to extend our research to gain a better
      understanding of the social welfare implications for the
      users of these platforms by better identifying them and
      accordingly discriminating content targeted to them.</p>
      <p>This work will become increasingly critical to platforms,
      advertisers, and consumers as returns become easier and more
      purchases are not only made online but also consumed online.
      It is estimated that product returns in the US have reached
      over <font style="normal">$</font>100 billion per year
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>], with
      annual growth as high as 21% according to Accenture. Although
      product returns are considered in some retail business
      models, this still imposes a huge financial burden on
      manufactures and retailers and negatively influences brand
      image. Thus, understanding consumers’ needs and concerns
      after purchase can also help retailers to reduce product
      returns.</p>
      <p>There are a number of limitations to the current study. By
      using found randomization of advertising, the distribution of
      links is less than optimal; we look forward to future studies
      in which we can make different choices to optimize results.
      Further, we are constantly updating how we identify purchase
      and look forward to reducing the asymmetric identification of
      searchers in the purchase funnel.</p>
