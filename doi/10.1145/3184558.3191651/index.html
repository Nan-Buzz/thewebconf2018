          Introduction</h2>

      <p>The continuous generation of content in social-media
      networks originates real-time data streams that need to be
      filtered and analyzed, to identify relevant information
      towards end users. The TREC RTS track aims to tackle these
      issues through the delivery of the most relevant tweets in a
      near real-time push notifications scenario, or in a delayed
      digest in the daily summarization scenario. The two scenarios
      share the criteria of delivering relevant and diverse
      information. This track introduces new challenges such as,
      dealing with a dataset that is continuously expanding and
      prepare algorithms to face different relevance distributions
      over time.</p>
      <p>The top two ranking teams [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] of the 2016 edition of the track,
      leveraged on a threshold definition for the detection of
      diverse documents. Both teams defined a similarity measure
      and trained their model on the TREC Microblog 2015 dataset,
      to set a diversity threshold. For the 2017 edition of the RTS
      track, we followed a similar approach for summarizing
      topics.</p>
      <p>The real-time constraints of the track will dictate the
      strategy to detect diverse documents. The two main strategies
      consist in the comparison between all submitted tweets, or
      between a tweet and the vocabulary set of the summary.
      Despite the <em>document-to-document</em> comparison improved
      performance when compared with <em>document-to-set</em>
      approach [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>],
      the latter is less resource expensive which can be crucial in
      a mobile scenario.</p>
      <p>With our participation, we studied the impact of different
      summarization approaches. The summarization study was further
      explored through the utilization of clustering and topic
      models. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of standard
      clustering and topic modeling methods when faced with a text
      stream dataset. The summarization techniques are described in
      Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-5">2</a>, the achieved
      results are presented in Section <a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-6">3</a>, and the conclusions in Section <a class="sec"

      <p>Diversity is measured by the similarity between documents
      and is one of the principal criteria to evaluate the
      performance of the systems participating in the TREC RTS
      track. The relevance assessment of the RTS track relies on
      semantic clustering. The semantic clustering [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] was made by the National
      Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) assessors, which
      focused on grouping tweets that present similar content. The
      relevance evaluation using clustering penalizes the
      submission of similar tweets that appear after the submission
      of a seminal tweet. In this paper, we use the notation of
      cluster interchangeably with subtopic. To achieve a perfect
      score, systems must submit the most relevant tweet of each
      assessed cluster. We have chosen to study the following
      popular algorithms, K-means, NMF, LDA, and DTM.</p>

        <p>The utilized dataset was built by listening to the
        Twitter 1% stream during eight days, between 29th of July
        and 5th of August of 2017, UTC. This dataset was utilized
        in the TREC RTS track. We leveraged on the relevance
        judgments made by the NIST assessors, both regarding the
        tweets relevance and the cluster assignments.</p>
        <p>We defined our task as the comparison of the grouping
        performance, in a fine-grained scenario, of commonly
        utilized clustering and topic modeling techniques. In our
        experiments, we wanted to observe how close the standard
        techniques would approximate the ideal clustering for the
        RTS track.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>We focused our analysis in two main components. The
        subtopic evolution through time, and the algorithms’
        performance to discover subtopics.</p>
        <section id="sec-9">
          <p><em>3.2.1 Subtopic evolution.</em> In Figure <a class=
          "fig" href="#fig1">1</a> we illustrate the evolution of
          the accumulated relevance of topics, RTS207 and RTS47,
          over the evaluation period. The first plot presented on
          the left depicts the total accumulated relevance of the
          topics. The following plots present the relevance
          evolution of the three clusters, with a higher
          accumulated relevance for the chosen topics. Each
          document could be evaluated as not relevant, relevant,
          and highly-relevant.</p>
          <p>We can observe three relevance distributions, by
          analyzing the three subtopics of each topic, that
          algorithms must be able to detect. First, we can observe
          subtopics with a reasonably uniform growth rate, e.g.,
          subtopics 1456 and 1490 of topic RTS207, and subtopic
          2016 of topic RTS47. This behavior can be interpreted as
          sub-streams of interest that are being updated during the
          evaluation period.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we can see subtopics that have a spike in
          accumulated relevance in a short time span, e.g.,
          subtopic 1159 of topic RTS47. This subtopic distribution
          can be explained as events that became main sub-streams
          of the topic being studied, due to the intense
          publication of documents in social-media.</p>
          <p>Finally, we observe that some subtopics reach a
          plateau earlier, e.g., subtopics 1753 and 1772 of topic
          RTS47. These can be interpreted as sub-streams of
          interest that had an impact towards the main topic, yet
          were isolated events without follow-up, or fading events
          before the beginning of the evaluation period.</p>
          <p>Retrieval systems are typically directed to find all
          or the most relevant documents. However, the delivery of
          real-time information presents more subtle challenges,
          which depend on the prediction of incoming information.
          Hence, new clustering and diversity approaches must be
          studied to meet the requirements introduced by these
          real-time relevance distributions.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sec-10">
          <p><em>3.2.2 Subtopic discovery.</em> For the discovery
          of subtopics, we leveraged on the NMI and ARI metrics to
          assess the similarity between the obtained and ideal
          clusters. For each algorithm, we provided the optimal
          number of subtopics, for each topic.</p>
          <p>In Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> we can
          observe a comparison among the considered algorithms
          considering the chosen metrics. NMF is the method that
          approximated more closely the optimal clustering,
          surpassing all other metrics both in NMI and ARI.
          Followed by the K-Means variations, which performed
          closely to NMF, both in NMI and ARI, especially using the
          JS divergence. LDA and DTM performance was poor due to
          the lack of textual elements, and documents to train the
          model.</p>
          <p>We found that NMF and K-Means worked better in the
          subtopic identification task for short documents.
          Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement, with
          both methods diverging from the perfect clustering.</p>

      <p>The analysis of different data grouping methods allowed us
      to conclude which of the currently used methods are more
      suitable towards the discovery of sub-streams of interest.
      The shortness of the documents presents itself as a challenge
      towards this objective. NMF presented good performance in the
      simulated post hoc task, using the oracle condition of
      knowing the number of subtopics in advance. Further work is
      needed to determine a suitable similarity metric, sensitive
      to small yet meaningful changes in document vocabulary. With
      a more accurate similarity, an improved document
      summarization can be achieved. Ultimately, swiftly adapting
      to the subtle dynamics of the stream.</p>
