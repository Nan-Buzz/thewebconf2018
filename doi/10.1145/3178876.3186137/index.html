        <p><small>We investigate the alignment of international
        attention of news media organizations within 193 countries
        with the expressed international interests of the public
        within those same countries from March 7, 2016 to April 14,
        2017. We collect fourteen months of longitudinal data of
        online news from Unfiltered News and web search volume data
        from Google Trends and build a multiplex network of media
        attention and public attention in order to study its
        structural and dynamic properties. Structurally, the media
        attention and the public attention are both similar and
        different depending on the resolution of the analysis. For
        example, we find that 63.2% of the country-specific media
        and the public pay attention to different countries, but
        local attention flow patterns, which are measured by
        network motifs, are very similar. We also show that there
        are strong regional similarities with both media and public
        attention that is only disrupted by significantly major
        worldwide incidents (e.g., Brexit). Using Granger
        causality, we show that there are a substantial number of
        countries where media attention and public attention are
        dissimilar by topical interest. Our findings show that the
        media and public attention toward specific countries are
        often at odds, indicating that the public within these
        countries may be ignoring their country-specific news
        outlets and seeking other online sources to address their
        media needs and desires.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>

      <p>Foreign news coverage by domestic media outlets shapes
      public perceptions of foreign countries&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>], formulates the public
      opinion, and offers the basis for policymakers to react to
      salient issues&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>]. The fundamental question, then, is
      which countries are covered by domestic media outlets and
      which are not. While there has been a stream of research to
      reveal systematic factors concerning foreign news
      coverage&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0047">47</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>], the media outlets are not isolated
      but interact with the audience by monitoring their interests
      through view counts, likes, or retweets&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0056">56</a>]. Therefore, such an
      approach of focusing only on the media might reveal only a
      part of the story. However, surprisingly, the spatiotemporal
      alignment of the news coverage and public interests has been
      relatively unexplored. As the news industry becomes
      competitive and the public has easier access to various news
      sources, the consideration of the alignment with the public
      interests is required for media outlets to survive.</p>
      <p>In this research, we compare and contrast the foreign news
      coverage and public interests for a wide range of countries.
      We call them <em>media attention</em> and <em>public
      attention</em>, respectively. In order to model the media
      attention and the public attention, we collect the daily top
      100 popular topics for each of 193 countries from Unfiltered
      News&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>],
      which is an online news aggregator using Google News data,
      and web search volume data from one country about another
      country among the same 193 countries from Google
      Trends&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]
      during a fourteen-month period from March 7, 2016 to April
      14, 2017.</p>
      <p>Our research questions are as follows:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="•">RQ1: How are media attention and
        public attention structurally aligned?<br /></li>
        <li id="list2" label="•">RQ2: What is the causal
        relationship between media attention and public
        attention?<br /></li>
        <li id="list3" label="•">RQ3: Are there topical aspects
        that affect the interaction between media attention and
        public attention?<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>By using our longitudinal data collection, we build a
      multiplex network consisting of the media attention layer and
      the public attention layer among the 193 countries. The
      topological analyses of the structures of the multiplex
      network and time series analyses of link weights on both
      layers quantitatively address our research questions.</p>

        <p>Before the digital era, news outlets were the primary
        routes for ordinary people to receive information on events
        taking place abroad. Ever since Galtung and
        Ruge&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]
        proposed the idea of news value and its relation to news
        selection, the studies that followed have revealed various
        factors&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>], such as the power relationship
        among countries&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0054">54</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0055">55</a>], to explain what influences
        foreign news coverage. Sometimes those factors form a bias
        in the news presented. For instance, Joye&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>] observed
        a bias in Western news media toward a
        Euro-American-centered world order. Early studies focusing
        on a few countries showed inconsistent influential factors
        due to cultural, regional, and political differences, such
        as Western society vs. non-Western society&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>]. In
        1984, Sreberny-Mohammadi conducted a seminal study on
        foreign news coverage based on a dataset collected from 46
        countries&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0043">43</a>]. This data has been analyzed
        further and helped to confirm the critical role of
        geographical and economic proximity between countries
        regarding foreign news coverage&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0044">44</a>]. New publicly available
        news datasets, such as the GDELT project&nbsp;[<a class=

        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>] and

        <p>The conventional way to understand salient issues is to
        conduct polls; Gallup's “What do you think is the most
        important problem facing this country today?” has been the
        de facto standard question to understand salient issues in
        U.S. society since the 1960s. While such polls are used as
        primary sources for longitudinal studies of public
        opinion&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>], they require time and resources
        to scale up.</p>
        <p>As Internet connectivity has become pervasive, the
        online information seeking behavior of the public, such as
        Discussion in AOL's “Today's News”&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>There have been several attempts to understand the
        interplay between media attention and public attention.
        Towers et al. examined the relationship between Internet
        searches and the news coverage on Ebola in the United
        States&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0045">45</a>]. By using Granger causality, they
        found that news coverage is a significant driver of web
        searches. Weeks and Southwell investigated the relationship
        between Internet searches and the news coverage on the
        rumor that Barack Obama was secretly Muslim&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0050">50</a>], and
        they discovered the correlation between them peaked on the
        day of publication. Mukherjee and Jansen&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>] studied
        the effect of advertising during major sporting events.
        They reported that advertising has a direct impact on web
        searching. While most of the studies on the relationships
        between news coverage and Internet searches are based on
        one or a few topics, our work examines general foreign news
        coverage and web searches over a fourteen-month period.</p>

        <p>Unfiltered News, which is a web service from Jigsaw
        (formerly Google Ideas), indexes news articles in the
        database of Google News and allows users to explore its
        collection. Particularly, topic- and country-level user
        interfaces allow users to explore a list of popular topics
        mentioned by news media in a specific country on a
        particular day. The topic is an entity in the Google
        Knowledge Graph&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]. The types of topics, which are
        the standard schema.org types, such as Person and Place,
        can be used to distinguish homonyms.</p>
        <p>We build our own crawler with a reasonable delay between
        requests so that the performance of the server is not
        degraded. We collect the daily top 100 popular topics,
        which is the maximum number of topics offered by Unfiltered
        News, in each country for every day from March 7, 2016 to
        April 14, 2017. For each topic, we collect its metadata
        using the Google Knowledge Graph API&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. This metadata contains
        several fields that are useful for further analyses. These
        fields are the unique identifier, name, type, and
        description. Particularly, the unique identifier is used to
        match the entity between Unfiltered News and Google Trends.
        We provide detailed explanations of this in Section 3.2.
        Finally, we collect the topics that are mentioned together
        with any of the daily top 100 popular topics per country
        every day, which are called <em>co-mentions</em>. For
        example, if news media outlets in the U.S. mention North
        Korea due to its nuclear weapons, the co-mentions are the
        nuclear weapons. As our aim in this work is to examine the
        attention among countries, we focus only on when the topic
        concerns another country. As a result, we have 1,322,730
        records of media attention between countries and 152,557
        unique co-mentions with them.</p>

            Trends as Public Attention</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>To collect the data from Google Trends, we use
        Pytrends&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>], which offers a Python interface
        to access the data that can be accessed via the web
        interface of Google Trends. The data from Google Trends is
        a time series of the daily (or weekly) search volume of a
        given keyword (or multiple keywords) during a given time
        window. Here, the search volume is not offered as an
        absolute number but as a normalized value between 0 and
        100. The normalization sets the highest search volume in a
        given time window as 100. The temporal resolution of the
        search volume is a day when the size of the given time
        window is small and a week when the size of the time window
        is big. We find that the time window of seven months is
        reasonably long and still has the temporal resolution of a
        day. Thus, we use the time window of seven months in
        sending a query through PyTrends. Along with the news
        coverage data collected from Unfiltered News from March 7,
        2016 to April 14, 2017, we gather the web search volume
        data from the same period. That is, for each country, we
        collect how many Google search queries about other
        countries are entered during those 404 days by sending two
        separate requests, each having a time window of seven
        months. We make an overlap of one day between the two
        requests. The purpose of that one day is to make a
        continuous time series of 404 days to have the same
        normalization scale. We explain in detail how to
        concatenate two time series data in Section&nbsp;<a class=
        "sec" href="#sec-15">3.4</a>.</p>
        <p>A language issue exists in this process. For instance,
        the United States is written as ‘Los Estados Unidos’ in
        Spanish. This means that, to get the correct search volume
        from one country about other countries, we need to know
        their names in the language of the corresponding country.
        Also, the abbreviation of countries might be another issue.
        It is not straightforward to find all of the abbreviations
        for every country in every language. Google Trends
        addresses this potential issue by using the Google
        Knowledge Graph Entity Identifier. This identifier is
        uniquely assigned to the concept. For instance, an
        identifier of <tt>/m/09c7w0</tt> indicates the concept of
        the country of the United States of America. Thus, the
        search volume of <tt>/m/09c7w0</tt> contains all the
        variations of the language and the abbreviations of the
        United States that Google can recognize. We get the Google
        Knowledge Graph Entity identifiers of each country through
        Google Knowledge Graph API&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] and query search
        volumes by using them.</p>
        <p>Like co-mentions in Unfiltered News, Google Trends
        provides related topics that are the keywords that are
        searched together for a given keyword. However, with a
        tight rate limit, it is infeasible to collect all of the
        related topics. Therefore, in this work, we do not cover
        the co-search keywords and leave it for future work.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The co-mentions collected from Unfiltered News describe
        the context of media attention from one country to another.
        We use word embeddings&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>] for the topic inference of each
        co-mention. We use the largest Glove pre-trained word
        vectors of 840B tokens and 300-dimensional
        vectors&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>]. From manually comparing several
        news sites, we build a set of 11 common topics, such as
        world, politics, business, tech, science, health, sports,
        arts, style, food, and travel. Then, for each co-mention,
        we compute the distance from each topic and assign the
        topic to the shortest distance. For example, as the
        co-mention ‘visa’ is closest to ‘travel’ rather than other
        10 topics, we regard visa as a travel-related
        co-mention.</p>

        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> summarizes
        the concatenation of two time series from Google Trends. As
        an example, the figure explains the case when we get the
        search volume for Korea (KR) and the U.S. (US) from a
        certain country. The first request is sent with a time
        window of the seven months from March 7, 2016 to October 7,
        2016, and the second request is with a time window from
        October 7, 2016 to April 14, 2017. To concatenate the
        corresponding time series from the two requests, we should
        have a reference that does not change even though Google
        Trends normalizes the search volumes within a given time
        window. For that, we use the search volume for the United
        States on October 7, 2016 (colored as a blue box) as a
        reference. To handle the potential case when it is zero, we
        add 1 to the search volumes. As the search volume for the
        U.S. on October 7, 2016 in the first request becomes 40 by
        adding 1 to the original search volume (39), to make it to
        100, we multiply all the values of the time series in the
        first request by 100/40=2.5. Similarly, as the search
        volume for the U.S. on October 7, 2016 in the second
        request is 80 after the addition of 1, to make it to 100,
        we multiply all the values of the time series in the second
        request by 100/80=1.25. Then, as a result, we get the time
        series from March 7, 2016 to April 14, 2017 by
        concatenating the corresponding time series from the two
        requests. By repeating this process, we get a set of the
        time series representing the search volume from one country
        to another. Since we use the search volume for the U.S.
        from one country as a reference in building every time
        series from the same country, all the resulting time series
        from that country have the same scale and thus can be
        comparable.</p>

      For example, phone calls, Facebook posts, or WhatsApp

      representing different types of social interactions.
      Similarly, we build a multiplex network of attention among
      countries. The attention has two types: media attention and
      public attention. The former is captured by news coverage,
      and the latter is captured by web search volume. Each country
      is mapped into a node of the multiplex network, and a link is
      established when the attention from one country to another
      exists. The link weight represents the strength of the
      attention.</p>

            Attention Layer</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Media attention is modeled as news coverage of one
        country by another. If the news media of a country
        <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> reports on a country
        <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> , we say that media attention exists
        from the country <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> to the country
        <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> . To capture the temporal dynamics,
        we do our modeling on a daily basis. On a specific day
        <em>t</em>, a network in the media attention layer (called
        a media attention network in the rest) denoted by
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{M}_t$</span></span> has a link
        from <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> to <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> only
        when media attention exists from <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> to
        <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> on day <em>t</em>. The weight of
        links from <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> to <em>c<sub>j</sub></em>
        is the number of news articles mentioning
        <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> published by news media in
        <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> . We eliminate self-loops, which
        represent domestic news.</p>
        <p>Once we have <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{M}_t$</span></span> for all
        <em>t</em> ∈ T where T is our data collection period, we
        build an aggregated network N<sup>M</sup> by superimposing
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{M}_t$</span></span> for all
        <em>t</em> ∈ T as follows: 1) if a node or a link exists in
        any <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{M}_t$</span></span> , it also
        exists in N<sup>M</sup>; and 2) the weight of the link from
        <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> to <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> in
        N<sup>M</sup> is the sum of the weights of the same link in
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\mathrm{N}^\mathrm{M}_t$</span></span> where
        <em>t</em> ∈ T.</p>
        <p>The resulting network might have lots of links among
        countries. Considering the different sizes of the media
        markets across the countries, it is not trivial to find a
        global threshold of the link weights for pruning.
        Therefore, we use a locally computed threshold by a
        disparity filter&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0041">41</a>] with a predefined confidence level
        to prune the network. Intuitively, this filter finds
        statistically significant links at every node. The links
        discovered by the disparity filter are called the
        <em>backbone</em> of the network, which is denoted by
        B(·).</p>

        <p>The backbone extraction effectively prunes the networks.
        Only 7.50% and 4.05% of the links are retained in the
        backbone of the media attention network and the public
        attention network, respectively. The assortativity shows an
        interesting trend. In N<sup>M</sup>, it is negative;
        however, in its backbone network B(N<sup>M</sup>), it is
        positive. This means that significant media attention,
        captured in the backbone network, is exchanged among the
        countries that have similar degrees because <em>α</em> &gt;
        0, but such tendency does not appear in general media
        attention exchange because of <em>α</em> ≈ 0. As the
        undirected network converted from N<sup>P</sup> consists of
        one fully connected network and a single isolated node
        (Rèunion), the assortativity in N<sup>P</sup> cannot be
        computed. The low reciprocity in the backbone reveals the
        asymmetric nature of the significant media and public
        attention.</p>

        <p>We first focus on important countries in both attention
        networks. If one country gets major media attention from
        other countries, does it also get major attention from the
        public (and vice versa)? To address this question, we
        compare the centrality of countries in the media attention
        network and the public attention network. The Spearman
        correlation coefficients of the degree centrality,
        betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and
        closeness centrality between B(N<sup>M</sup>) and
        B(N<sup>P</sup>) are 0.562, 0.548, 0.658, and 0.653 (all
        <em>p</em> &lt; 0.0001), respectively. All of these
        positive coefficients show the moderate positive
        relationship between the two; the country receiving the
        high media (public) attention generally gets the high
        public (media) attention as well, but the alignment is not
        perfect.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The positive correlations of node centrality imply a
        structural similarity between media attention and public
        attention. Then, the question that naturally follows is
        whether or not such structural similarity can be found at
        other levels, such as a dyadic level. If a country
        <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> pays the highest media attention to
        a country <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> , does the highest public
        attention from <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> also go to
        <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> ?</p>
        <p>To answer this question in a robust way, we first make
        the question more general with consideration of the top
        <em>k</em> countries who get the media (or public)
        attention from <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> . We call these top@k
        neighbors of <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> . For example, top@1
        neighbor of one country is the country that gets the most
        attention from that country, and top@10 neighbors are the
        top 10 countries that get the most attention from that
        country. Then, the new question is about whether these
        top@k neighbors are common or not between N<sup>M</sup> and
        N<sup>P</sup>.</p>

        </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution of the
        Jaccard coefficients of the top@k neighbors for each node
        between N<sup>M</sup> and N<sup>P</sup> with varying
        <em>k</em>. The figure shows that the structural
        characteristics of media attention and public attention are
        different at the dyadic level, which is opposite to high
        correlations of node centrality. The media and the public
        pay the most attention (<em>k</em>=1) to different
        countries in 63.2% of the whole countries, while they pay
        the greatest attention to the same countries in 36.8% of
        cases. The median of the Jaccard coefficients is 0.0, 0.2,
        0.429, and 0.429 for <em>k</em>=1,3,5, and 10,
        respectively. This shows a structural discrepancy between
        media attention and public attention at the dyadic level;
        the media and the public in one country are usually
        interested in different countries.</p>
        <p>Among 122 countries whose top@1 neighbor is different
        between N<sup>M</sup> and N<sup>P</sup>, the media of 27.0%
        pay the most attention to the United States, followed by
        China (8.1%), Syria (5.8%), Egypt (4.1%), and the United
        Kingdom (5%). These countries have ‘news value,’ in that
        they are frequently reported on by the media, but they fail
        to attract a similar amount of public attention. This can
        be partially explained by the media's heavy attention to
        the United States; the media in 64 out of 193 countries pay
        the most attention to the U.S., but more than a half of
        them have a public that pays the most attention to other
        countries instead, such as Germany and Japan. Conversely,
        in only 10 countries does the public pay the most attention
        to the U.S. while the media pays attention to other
        countries.</p>
        <p>In addition to the emphasis on the United States by the
        media, we test two more factors that are known to influence
        news coverage, which are the distance [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0047">47</a>] and trade
        volumes&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>] between countries. Do they also
        influence public attention? First, we compare the distance
        from each country to its top@1 neighbor, which is measured
        by the distance between the capital cities of the two
        countries, in N<sup>M</sup> and N<sup>P</sup> by a
        Mann-Whitney's U test and find no significant difference
        (<em>p</em>-value=0.18,0.16,0.30, and 0.16 for
        <em>k</em>=1,3,5, and 10, respectively). Second, we compile
        a list of leading export and import trading partners for
        each country and compare them with top@1 neighbor in
        N<sup>M</sup> and N<sup>P</sup>. We exclude countries that
        have ‘European Union’ as a leading export or import trading
        partner because it is a union of countries and is not a
        unit of analysis. As a result, we have a list of 114
        countries that have a leading export and import trading
        partners. Among them, we find that 37 (32.5%) and 34
        (29.8%) countries pay the highest attention to their
        leading importers or exporters in N<sup>M</sup> and
        N<sup>P</sup>, respectively. No statistically significant
        difference is confirmed by a Chi-square test
        (<em>p</em>-value=0.7749). Thus, the distance and trade
        volume between countries do not differently influence the
        dyadic relationships between N<sup>M</sup> and
        N<sup>P</sup>.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether or not the top@k neighbors are
        temporally stable, we compute the monthly changes of the
        median Jaccard coefficients of the top@k neighbors in
        N<sup>M</sup> and N<sup>P</sup> with varying <em>k</em>.
        The median Jaccard coefficients are stable, which are 0.0,
        0.2, 0.25, and 0.33 when <em>k</em>=1,3,5, and 10,
        respectively, except for the increase in June (0.417) and
        July (0.429) when <em>k</em>=10. By manual inspection, we
        find that these peaks are driven by two incidents: The
        United Kingdom European Union membership referendum
        (Brexit) on June 23, 2016 and the Nice attack resulting in
        the deaths of 86 people and the injury of 458 others on
        July 14, 2016. In June 2016, 103 countries paid the highest
        media and public attention to the United Kingdom, while the
        United Kingdom's average attention number is 56.3. Also, in
        July 2016, 125 countries paid the highest media and public
        attention to France, while its average attention number is
        only 42.5. The convergence of the media attention in both
        periods is previously reported in&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]. We additionally observe
        the convergence of public attention as well as the media
        attention around Brexit and the Nice attack. Such strong
        convergence between the media and the public attention is
        not otherwise observed during the fourteen-month data
        collection period.</p>

        <p>In the previous subsection, we showed the difference
        between media and public attention at the dyadic level,
        particularly focusing on the top@k neighbors, but how much
        of the attention of one country goes to the top@k
        neighbors? How skewed are media and public attention from
        one country to another? To answer this question, we compute
        the Gini coefficients of the link weights for each
        node.</p>
        <figure id="fig3">
          <img src=

        </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>The Gini coefficient measures the statistical dispersion
        or inequality of a given distribution. Basically, a higher
        coefficient indicates more inequality or a skewed
        distribution. The minimum value is zero when the given
        distribution is uniform (perfect equality), and the maximum
        value is one when the given distribution is maximally
        skewed. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> shows
        the cumulative distribution of Gini coefficients of link
        weights for each node in N<sup>M</sup> and N<sup>P</sup>.
        First, the widespread Gini coefficients in N<sup>M</sup>
        and N<sup>P</sup> mean that the distribution of link
        weights is quite diverse across the countries. Some
        countries, such as Yemen (0.92 in N<sup>M</sup>) or
        Gibraltar (0.80 in N<sup>P</sup>) pay significant attention
        to a few countries only, but other countries, such as the
        Central African Republic (0.17 in N<sup>M</sup>) and Canada
        (0.13 in N<sup>P</sup>), pay attention to other countries
        more equally. Second, the cumulative distribution of the
        Gini coefficients in N<sup>P</sup> is positioned at the
        left of that in N<sup>M</sup>. This shows that the public
        attention goes more equally to other countries than the
        media attention does. The medians of the Gini coefficients
        in N<sup>P</sup> and N<sup>M</sup> are 0.374 and 0.799,
        respectively. We confirm that the difference of Gini
        coefficients between N<sup>P</sup> and N<sup>M</sup> is
        statistically significant by a Mann-Whitney's U test
        (U=1887.0, p-value=6.0e-53).</p>
        <p>As we expected from Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig3">3</a>, the Gini coefficients of each node in
        N<sup>M</sup> and N<sup>P</sup> have almost no correlation
        (Spearman correlation <em>ρ</em>=-0.03,
        <em>p</em>-value=0.669). This is additional evidence that
        the media and the public pay attention to other countries
        in different ways by focusing on different countries with
        different strengths.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Through the analysis of top@k neighbors and Gini
        coefficients of link weights, we can observe the structural
        differences between media attention and public attention at
        the dyadic level. We now move on to the more complicated
        unit of the analysis, a triad sometimes called a
        three-sized motif. In a directed network, there are 13
        different three-sized motifs based on how they are
        connected. The <em>x</em>-axis in Figure&nbsp;<a class=
        "fig" href="#fig4">4</a> shows a list of them. The
        intuition behind the motif analysis is that the proportions
        of each of the 13 different motifs reveal the
        characteristics of the entire network&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>]. For example, a fully
        connected triad (13th motif in the figure) is
        overrepresented in a social network than a random network
        due to the reciprocal nature of human interactions, and in
        a food web network, a feed-forward loop (FFL, 5th motif in
        the figure) is overrepresented than in a random network due
        to the hierarchy in a food chain.</p>
        <p>We compute the motif profiles in the backbone of the
        media attention network and the public opinion network by
        using Fanmod&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0051">51</a>], and the resulting Z-score for
        each motif is presented in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig4">4</a>. A positive (negative) Z-score means that the
        corresponding motif is overrepresented (underrepresented)
        as compared to the null model, which is an ensemble of the
        1,000 random networks with the same degree
        distribution.</p>
        <p>We find that both networks show the similar motif
        profiles; fan-in and fan-out motifs are underrepresented,
        FFL and double feedback loop motif (6th motif) are
        overrepresented, and a fully connected motif is
        overrepresented. Considering that we discovered noticeable
        structural differences between media attention and public
        attention in previous experiments, their well-aligned motif
        profiles are somewhat unexpected. The overrepresented FFL
        implies the existence of a hierarchy structure in the
        network. Like a food chain, the FFL shows a transitive
        hierarchy. Questioning and answering patterns in Yahoo!
        Q&amp;A also show this hierarchy because a senior expert
        can answer both easy and hard questions but a junior expert
        can answer easy questions only&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. In the media attention
        and the public attention network, an example of countries
        forming the FFL is [Algeria → France, Algeria → the U.S.,
        and France → the U.S.]. The public in Algeria pays
        significant attention to France and the U.S. and that in
        France to the U.S., but the public in the U.S. does not pay
        significant attention to either of them. Likewise,
        influential countries (e.g., G8), such as the United
        Kingdom [Luxembourg → Belgium, Luxembourg → the United
        Kingdom, Belgium → the United Kingdom] or Japan [Malaysia →
        Bangladesh, Malaysia → Japan, Bangladesh → Japan], form
        many FFLs in both attention networks. Many of the
        overrepresented fully connected motifs are observed from
        geographically closely located countries, such as [Brazil,
        Argentina, Paraguay], [Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
        Serbia], and [China, Hong Kong, Macau]. As neighboring
        countries are likely to share linguistic, historical, or
        cultural similarities, it is reasonable that their media
        and public pay attention to each other.</p>

        media attention and public attention as shown in the table.
        First, a strong regionalism can be found in both but with a
        slightly different magnitude. Regarding media attention,
        Asia and Europe pay attention to themselves the most, but
        other regions do the second most. By contrast, regarding
        public attention, except Oceania, all the regions pay the
        most attention to themselves. Second, the emergence of Asia
        as a receiver of the media attention is noticeable, while
        it is not visible in the public attention. All of the
        regions except for Europe pay the highest level of
        attention to Asia, and even Europe pays the second-highest
        level. Finally, the public pays attention more equally than
        the media does. This is what we found at the country level
        in Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-23">5.3</a>, and
        it is again observed at the region level. The median Gini
        coefficients of the media and the public are 0.439 (Europe)
        and 0.317 (Americas). We confirm that the difference is
        statistically significant by Mann-Whitney's U test (U=3.0,

        <p>Among various community identification methods, we use
        InfoMAP&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0039">39</a>] based on a random walk that can
        incorporate the direction of the links by nature. We
        visualize the identified communities in B(N<sup>M</sup>)
        and B(N<sup>P</sup>) in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig6">6</a>(a) and (b), respectively. The countries in
        the same community are painted the same color. We find 16
        and 14 communities in B(N<sup>M</sup>) and
        B(N<sup>P</sup>), respectively. From the figure, the
        primary difference is the coverage of the biggest
        community. In B(N<sup>M</sup>), there is one giant
        community of 80 countries from the whole world, such as
        Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Africa, showing
        the ‘global village’ trend of media attention previously
        reported in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>]. While the membership of the
        countries in the biggest community is slightly different
        from [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>], the pattern that the media
        attention does not stay within a geographical region but is
        exchanged globally is consistent. By contrast, the biggest
        community in B(N<sup>P</sup>) has 42 countries, which
        mainly consist of European and Oceanian countries. No
        country in other regions is included in the biggest
        community in B(N<sup>P</sup>). Instead, regional splits are
        clear where public attention is exchanged.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, several groups of geographically closely
        located countries bring the notion of civilizations
        proposed by Huntington&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>] to mind. He argued that
        “civilizations” sharing a cultural and religious identity
        become important to understand conflicts in the post-Cold
        War world. His concept of civilization has been widely used
        to understand the division of the world, for example, in
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>].
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>(c) shows the
        map of civilizations. We can see that some of the
        civilizations appear as the identified communities in
        B(N<sup>M</sup>) and B(N<sup>P</sup>) with the addition or
        removal of few countries. Revealing this fine-grained
        variation from the civilizations originally proposed in the
        late 90s&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>] poses an interesting research
        challenge. Are the cultural lines Huntington discovered
        changing due to connectivity and globalization trends? The
        fact that the core of civilizations is still consistently
        observed in media attention and public attention proves the
        validity of the original civilizations, but the trend of
        the global village and other variations require new models
        and explanations for today's international relations.</p>

            Causality Analysis</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Granger causality is a statistical concept of causality
        between two time series. One time series T
        <sub><em>X</em></sub> <em>Granger-causes</em> the other
        time series T <sub><em>Y</em></sub> when past values of T
        <sub><em>X</em></sub> can improve the explanation of the
        current value of T <sub><em>Y</em></sub> compared to when
        past values of T <sub><em>Y</em></sub> are used alone.
        Granger causality has been widely used for causation
        analysis due to its computational simplicity. Our aim is to
        examine whether media attention Granger-causes public
        attention, public attention Granger-causes media attention,
        or both. To achieve this, for each country pair that exists
        both in N<sup>M</sup> and N<sup>P</sup>, we build two time
        series representing media attention and public attention
        each. We denote by <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathrm{T}^{c_i
        \rightarrow c_j}_{\mathrm{M}}$</span></span> the time
        series of the media attention from a country
        <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> to a country <em>c<sub>j</sub></em>
        , and <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\mathrm{T}^{c_i \rightarrow
        c_j}_{\mathrm{P}}$</span></span> the time series of the
        public attention from <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> to
        <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> .</p>

        </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>To examine whether media attention Granger-causes public
        attention, the null hypothesis is that <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathrm{T}^{c_i
        \rightarrow c_j}_{\mathrm{M}}$</span></span> does not
        Granger-cause <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\mathrm{T}^{c_i \rightarrow
        c_j}_{\mathrm{P}}$</span></span> . We test the hypothesis
        with varying time lags from 1 to 14 days. We reject the
        hypothesis when <em>p</em>-value &lt; 0.05 and say that
        media attention Granger-causes public attention with a time
        lag <em>l</em>. If two time series show a Granger-cause
        relationship with multiple <em>l</em>s, we choose the
        <em>l</em> with the largest <em>F</em> statistic (the
        smallest <em>p</em>-value). For the case that public
        attention Granger-causes media attention, the null
        hypothesis is that <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathrm{T}^{c_i
        \rightarrow c_j}_{\mathrm{P}}$</span></span> does not
        Granger-cause <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\mathrm{T}^{c_i \rightarrow
        c_j}_{\mathrm{M}}$</span></span> , and the rest of the
        process is the same.</p>
        <p>For the hypothesis testing, we note that we make time
        series stationary through appropriate transformation
        techniques such as differencing. Among 37,056 country
        pairs, we find that media attention Granger-causes public
        attention in 2,594 country pairs, and public attention
        Granger-causes media attention in 5,817 country pairs.
        Also, in 6,698 country pairs, we find that Granger-causal
        relationships in both directions exist. We illustrate how
        those relationships are geographically distributed in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a>.</p>
        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a>(a) shows
        the country pairs where media attention Gran-ger-causes
        public attention, (b) shows the country pairs where public
        attention Granger-causes media attention, and (c) shows the
        country pairs who have both Granger-causal relationships
        (an intersection of (a) and (b)). By comparing
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a> with the
        attention flows among regions in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig"
        href="#fig5">5</a>, we see some similarities and
        differences. In Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig7">7</a>(c), we can see that a stronger association
        between media attention and public attention when the
        attention pays to a country in the same region than to the
        other regions. The media attention or the public attention
        within the same region is not only higher than that across
        the regions (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a>)
        but also is likely to Granger-cause to its counterpart.
        However, the higher volume of media (or public) attention
        from one region to another does not guarantee that it
        Granger-causes more public (or media) attention in the
        corresponding pair of regions. This disagreement between
        media attention and public attention is consistent with a
        previous study comparing news articles and news
        comments&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>].</p>
        <p>We then investigate what determines the Granger-casual
        relationships. For this, we build a random forest model to
        predict whether a relationship from a source country to a
        destination country is divided into four classes: (1) media
        attention Granger-causes public attention, (2) public
        attention Granger-causes media attention, (3) both
        Granger-casual relationships exist, or (4) no
        Granger-casual relationship exists. For both source and
        destination countries, we incorporate tens of country
        properties, such as population, GDP, literacy rate,
        Internet penetration, press freedom index, and so on. Also,
        we consider topological characteristics of countries in
        N<sup>M</sup> and N<sup>P</sup>. Furthermore, we consider
        the distance between two countries for modeling the
        stronger ‘same region’ attention. As the number of the
        relationships for each class is largely different, we
        downsample the relationships for handling a class imbalance
        issue and make the number of observations for each class
        the same. We split the data 75% and 25% for training and
        testing, respectively. The accuracy of our resulting model
        is 99.81% better than the random guess baseline. We note
        that the goal of this model is to find the important
        variables for causal relationships rather than to build the
        best prediction model.</p>
        <p>The top five important variables from the trained model
        show what influences on Granger-causal relationships. They
        are: distance between two countries, out-degree in
        <em>B</em>(N<sup>M</sup>), GDP of the source country, the
        Internet penetration in the source country, and the GDP of
        the destination country. This is consistent with previous
        work that reveals the crucial role of the distance between
        countries and the GDP of a destination country for the news
        coverage by a source country&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>]. Also, other variables
        that can affect the behavior of information gaining and
        seeking can influence media attention and public
        attention.</p>

        <p>As we mentioned earlier, co-mentions reveal the context
        of media attention. Prior to the analysis of the
        topic-level interaction between the media attention and the
        public attention, we examine why each country is covered by

        </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig8">8</a> shows
        topics of co-mentions for each country. Of course, a
        country is covered due to a variety of reasons. To address
        this, for country <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> , we first check
        how many times each topic is co-mentioned by
        <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> . Then, we can find that the topic
        with the most appearance is the topic of media attention
        from <em>c<sub>j</sub></em> to <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> . By
        collecting the topics of media attention from each country
        to <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> and choosing the topics featured
        in most of the countries, we have the topic of why
        <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> is covered by the rest of the
        world.</p>
        <p>The association between a country and its topic fits in
        with our intuition well. Among the G8 countries, five
        (Germany, the U.K., the U.S., Canada, and Russia) are
        covered with ‘politics,’ and three (France, Italy, and
        Japan) are covered with ‘travel.’ France and Italy are
        actually the most popular and the fifth-most popular
        countries by international tourist arrivals, respectively,
        and Japan showed double-digit growth five years in a
        row&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0046">46</a>]. Also, popular destinations in
        Africa are listed by one of the famous travel guides,
        Lonely Planet. These include the Giza Pyramids in Egypt,
        the Okavango Delta in Botswana, and Etosha National Park in
        Tanzania, are also covered with ‘travel.’ In contrast to
        negative stereotyping of the third world by media attention
        in the early 2000s&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>], the emergence of balanced news
        coverage signifies the advancement of the media industry,
        while most of the other African countries are still covered
        with ‘politics.’ Countries that are known for football,
        such as Brazil, Argentina, or Spain, are covered with
        ‘sports.’</p>
        <p>We also examine how one country is covered by a set of
        countries in a specific region instead of the rest of the
        world. Due to the lack of the space, we omit the
        visualizations but share some common trends. First, the
        United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia are always
        covered with ‘politics’ by any region, showing their
        influence on today's world. Second, countries get covered
        with ‘travel’ more by the same region than other regions
        possibly due to its accessibility. Finally, we see several
        consistent connections between a country and a topic across
        the regions, such as Brazil and sports, and most of the
        Middle Eastern countries and politics.</p>
        <p>We repeat the same Granger causality analysis as we did
        in Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-28">6.1</a> by
        using topical media attention and public attention. While
        the overall trend is similar as before, such as a strong
        association between media attention and public attention
        within the same region, there are also interesting topical
        trends. The top five topics that lead to the most
        Granger-causal relationships in both directions are sports,
        travel, world, politics, and arts. High engagement of the
        public in the entertainment-oriented news (often called
        soft news&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>]) and supplies of such news by the
        media are well captured here. In the trained model, we
        achieve similar performance, which is 91.03% higher than
        the random baseline. The topic becomes the most important
        variable, as we expected, in addition to the top five
        variables in an earlier model.</p>

      <p>In this work, we examined the media attention and the
      public attention among 193 countries by using the data from
      Unfiltered News and Google Trends during more than one year.
      We discovered that the structural characteristics of media
      attention and public attention are similar at some levels and
      different at others: (1) the importance of a node
      (centrality) is positively correlated between two networks;
      (2) to whom one country pays significant attention is
      different between two networks; (3) the distribution of
      attention across neighbors is different between two networks,
      public attention being distributed more equally than the
      media attention; (4) the relationship among three countries
      is similar between two networks, with overrepresented
      feed-forward loops implying the transitive hierarchy of the
      attention, and the overrepresented fully connected triads
      meaning that attention is exchanged among geographically
      closely located countries, and (5) community structures of
      media attention show the trend of a global village, while
      those of public attention show clearer geographical splits.
      These similar and different two networks interact with each
      other in terms of Granger causality. We showed that media
      attention and the public attention within the same region
      strongly associate with each other. Along with distance,
      country properties influence the Granger causality. There are
      some variations in the interplay between the media attention
      and the public attention according to the topics.</p>
      <p>The structural alignment of media attention and public
      attention shows the interaction between the news media and
      the public opinion&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>]. On the one hand, the agenda-setting
      effects of the media influence public perceptions on foreign
      countries&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>], build consensus&nbsp;[<a class=

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>]. On the other hand, as social media
      becomes one of the most important channels with which to
      disseminate news&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>], it becomes easier for the media to
      collect public opinion about an issue. Also, reader metrics,
      such as clickstreams, likes, or shares, exert pressures on
      news selection by the media&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>]. Despite the interaction
      between the media and the public, the existence of the
      structural difference between the media attention and the
      public attention makes us revisit the old problem about the
      role of the journalists, editors, and media. It has long been
      debated where the line should be between what people want to
      read and what people ought to know&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0052">52</a>]. Also, the transfer from
      media salience to public salience does not always necessarily
      happen&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>].
      For example, when the news is not relevant for the audience

      <p>Across our experiments, two trends are consistently found:
      the global village trend and strong regionalism. The global
      village trend is more noticeable in the media attention than
      the public attention, which has been reported as the media
      convergence&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]. The international news agencies,
      such as AP, AFP, and Reuters, play an essential role in
      this&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>]. The
      clearer geographical splits in the public attention imply
      that the cultural affinity within a region matters more to
      individuals’ information-seeking behavior.</p>
      <p>There are potential limitations in this work. First, we
      model media attention and public attention from a single
      service each, which are Unfiltered News and Google Trends,
      respectively. However, since their actual data is aggregated
      from tens of thousands of news media and billions of
      individuals, the problem of generalizability is relatively
      limited. Second, we set the scope of the analysis as the
      foreign news coverage and the corresponding web search. This
      makes mapping the news coverage and the web search by using
      the names of countries as the unit of the analysis
      straightforward; nevertheless, at the same time, this does
      not cover the domestic media and public attention.
      Considering the aim of this research is to understand the
      attention among countries that can influence public
      perception of foreign countries and foreign policy, the
      domestic news and search do not distort the result. However,
      incorporating them as well would be an interesting direction
      for future research.</p>
