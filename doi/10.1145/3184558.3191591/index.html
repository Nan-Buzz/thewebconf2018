      <div class="abstract">
        <p><small>Social media interaction happens in a broad
        variety of context and magnitude. The vast majority of
        posts cause little to no discussion, while some start
        trends and become viral. We study the virality, explicitly
        of ’<em>Buzzes</em>’ - posts that evoke intense interaction
        over a short period of time, as they have been observed
        frequently, sometimes with severe consequences for
        individuals and companies in the physical world. Early
        detection of a <em>Buzz</em> may help mitigate or prevent
        negative consequences of large scale social media outrage
        against companies or persons, by giving them a chance to
        react at an early stage.</small></p>
        <p><small>Collecting a labeled set of over 100,000 posts on
        Facebook pages, we first explore properties that define a
        <em>Buzz</em> using logistic regression. This method helps
        us to interpret the results and derive practical
        recommendations. We subsequently train classifiers and
        apply machine learning based classification techniques to
        demonstrate the potential capabilities of automated
        prediction. We achieve high recall with moderate precision,
        where feature boosting on broad feature sets yields the
        most promising results.</small></p>
        <p><small>Our study reveals that <em>Buzzes</em> are well
        described by a high number of comments from previously
        passive users, a high number of likes given to comments,
        and a prolonged discussion period - properties that can be
        used to distinguish inconsequential posts from potentially
        volatile ones.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Online social network (OSN) communication is frequently
      dominated by a small number of <em>Buzzes</em> - posts that
      <em>“go viral”</em> and spread far beyond their initial
      source.</p>
      <p>Such a <em>Buzz</em> can have exceptional influence on
      popular discourse, and has the potential to strongly shape
      the public perception of products, companies, institutions,
      public figures, and regular individuals - both in a positive
      and a negative sense.</p>
      <p>For example in 2013 Justine Sacco, a PR executive, sent a
      tweet before boarding a plane: “Going to Africa. Hope I don't
      get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!”. The associated hashtags
      quickly rose to the number 1 trending spot on Twitter in a
      global outrage. She described the aftermath as “incredibly
      traumatic”<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, cutting short her trip and
      losing her job. In another example a popular lion had been
      shot and killed by an American dentist<a class="fn" href=
      "#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>, again prompting
      outrage that led to vandalism of his home and office.
      Whatever ones personal opinion on the actions of those
      individuals may be, these persecutions are irreconcilable
      with a lawful modern society. Private persons should not be
      subjected to dramatic consequences on their lives without
      undergoing any sort of due process or being allowed a chance
      to defend themselves against a worldwide mob. Recognizing the
      underlying dynamics of this phenomenon and giving the
      involved parties more time to react could help mitigate some
      of the fallout.</p>
      <p>A negative <em>Buzz</em> can be aimed at corporations as
      well, as happened in the case of Fedex, where an employee was
      filmed being less than gentle delivering a package<a class=
      "fn" href="#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Damage to
      the brand in such cases can be substantial and difficult to
      prevent through traditional PR methods. Companies have
      reacted to this by employing social media managers who not
      only quickly react to negative online stories concerning the
      company with clarifications or apologies, but also by
      amplifying positive developments. An early warning system can
      be effectively used by such managers to make faster and
      better decisions.</p>
      <p>As a final example, a <em>Buzz</em> does not need to be
      positive or negative. It can be benign as well, as happened
      in the case of “The Dress”<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id=
      "foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a>; a picture of a dress caused
      worldwide confusion as to which colors it was made of.</p>
      <p>This study analyzes such <em>Buzzes</em>. To provide
      scalable early detection, we aim at detecting them using only
      metadata from publicly available Facebook pages. Exploring
      their characteristics and the respective features using
      logistic regression first, we subsequently employ more
      advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Logistic
      regression is useful for interpretation of the results and
      can be used to directly derive recommendations for human
      decision makers, whereas the ML techniques yield superior
      classification results.</p>

      <p>Virality has been studied frequently in recent literature
      in a number of formats. We will focus on publications with an
      emphasis on discovering or predicting virality in some form
      through classification techniques, as those are most relevant
      to our work.</p>
      <p>Kaltenbrunner et al.[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] analyze the news site Slashdot in
      order to predict the number of comments a certain post will
      receive. Ma et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>] and Tsur and Rappoport [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>] predict
      the popularity of hashtags on Twitter. Specifically they
      predict the number of times a given hashtag appears within a
      certain time frame. They find that contextual, or structural,
      features are more significant than content features. While
      this finding supports our approach of considering metadata
      instead of content, we did not include rich structural data
      in our dataset.</p>
      <p>A number of publications are researching a phenomenon they
      call “cascades” [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. The idea being that a piece of
      content spreads by being shared and re-shared in a cascade
      like fashion. Cheng et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] predict the magnitude of such
      cascades, meaning the number of times a piece of content is
      shared in such a structure. Notably they avoid the problems
      that occur when examining extremely rare phenomena by
      reformulating the prediction problem such that instead of
      predicting the eventual size, they predict the likelihood of
      growing beyond the median size of all cascades that have
      grown at least as large.</p>
      <p>Other works examine the virality of specific types of
      content. Specifically image virality has been studied in
      several formats. Guerini et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] study visual content on Google Plus,
      while Deza and Parikh [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] examine the social news aggregation
      site Reddit and Szabo and Huberman [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>] analyze the portals Digg
      and YouTube.</p>
      <p>None of these publications approach the virality dynamic
      from a manually labeled dataset. Instead they rely on
      straight forward metrics, usually counting the number of
      shares, votes or likes, sometimes in combination with other
      metrics. We are not aware of publications that classify or
      predict virality in some form with a manually labeled ground
      truth.</p>

        <p>To study <em>Buzzes</em>, and to substantiate and
        evaluate our claims, we started by collecting metadata from
        76 public Facebook pages. We used the Facebook Graph API
        for this process, as it allows access to a rich set of
        metadata on its pages, particularly concerning posts. The
        specific data fields we gathered were:</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list1" label="•">name and likes of each
          page,<br /></li>
          <li id="list2" label="•">id, content, timestamp, likes
          and share count of each post and<br /></li>
          <li id="list3" label="•">id, content, timestamp, likes
          and commenter id of each comment on these
          posts.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We selected these pages based on observation of online
        newspapers and other websites that report on viral social
        media events.</p>

        </div>
        <p>We sanitized this data set, removing posts with
        inconsistent information reported by Facebook and pages
        that solely reposted content from elsewhere on Facebook.
        Post sanitization the final dataset consisted of a total of
        119,910 posts. To ensure enough time for the activity on a
        <em>Buzz</em> to develop, we also excluded all content that
        was posted within the last two weeks before collecting the
        sample. We analyzed the remaining dataset subsequently and
        four coders manually labeled each post as a <em>Buzz</em>
        or non-<em>Buzz</em>according to the following definition
        of <em>Buzzes</em>:</p>
        <p>“A <em>Buzz</em> is a specific post, behaviour, or topic
        which initially spreads via social media and that suddenly
        draws surprising as well as extraordinary attention leading
        to many views. In this respect, a post is a text, a video,
        and/or a picture. It can lead to certain online reactions
        such as liking, sharing, commenting on, emulating, and/or
        offline reactions such as participating in events or
        purchasing a certain item. In most cases this exceptional
        attention lasts for a few days or weeks. In rare cases it
        lasts for a few months. At the beginning, in most cases
        there is no news agency involvement. However, later on
        single media outlets might report on the hype.”</p>
        <p>Thereby, more than one fourth of the data was labelled
        by all four coders in order to control for their
        reliability. All the other posts were coded by at least two
        persons. In the case of disagreement, two of the authors
        discussed and decided on the final label.</p>

            Features</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>In the following section we explain the different
        features that we collected for further analysis (Table
        <a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> gives an overview of all
        the features we use).</p>
        <p>We collect all directly related metadata of posts, like
        the number of likes, shares, and comments on a post
        (<em>nolikes, noshares, nocomments</em>), as well as the
        average length of the comments on a post
        (<em>contentlength</em>) and the number of likes on the
        different comments (<em>commentlikes</em>).</p>
        <p>Considering the fact that some pages are much more
        popular than others, we add a feature of their division by
        the number of average likes, reshares, and comments for the
        respective page (<em>postlikes</em>, <em>postshares</em>,
        <em>comments</em>).</p>
        <p>We also discovered that the number of comments in direct
        reaction to the post (<em>firstlevel</em>) and replies to
        those comments (<em>replies</em>) vary strongly over the
        course of the online discussion and are each thus included
        as features.</p>
        <p>A <em>Buzz</em> is often characterized by many people
        discussing a certain topic and commenting on a given post.
        Holt shows that most participation in discussions is given
        when people debate different viewpoints [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]. Considering a post that
        deals with a controversial topic, many users will actually
        engage in discussing these “competing or alternative
        ideologies” [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]. News agencies picking up on and
        reporting the <em>Buzz</em> can act as an amplifier of the
        activity on the phenomenon, attracting additional,
        potentially commonly passive users to participate
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>,
        <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. As a
        consequence we also measure commonly active users
        (<em>oldusers</em>) and users that previously have not
        actively participated in discussions (<em>newusers</em>) on
        that page, as well as the percentage of new users
        (<em>newuserratio</em>).</p>
        <p>To cover the engagement in the discussions, we count the
        number of users that repeatedly comment or reply on the
        same post (<em>repeatusers</em>), and we divide the number
        of their comments on the post by the average number of
        comments of all users on the post.</p>
        <p>To reflect the temporal properties of <em>Buzzes</em>,
        we finally measure different temporal properties of the
        discussions. These include the frequency of interactions
        within the first hour after publication of a post
        (<span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$first\-hour\-interval$</span></span> ), as well as
        the number of comments during the first hour (<span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$first\-hour\-comments$</span></span> ) and during
        the peak activity of a discussion (<span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$max\-hour\-comments$</span></span> ), each divided
        by the overall activity. For <em>Buzzes</em> that seem to
        have reached the end of their discussion we measure the
        number of hours it lasted (<em>lasthour</em>), and we
        estimate a cumulative activity distribution by calculating
        the hours during which certain percentiles of the
        discussion has taken place (<span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$completeness\-index$</span></span> ). Finally, we
        calculate simple statistics of the temporal activity, by
        counting the number of extreme cases (minimum and maximum
        number of comments per hour, <em>extrema</em>), and the
        maximum and minimum gradient of activities
        (<em>maxderivative, minderivative</em>).</p>

      <p>To study <em>Buzzes</em> we explore the dataset using

            using Logistic Regression</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Classifying posts as <em>Buzzes</em> or
        non-<em>Buzzes</em>, we have a dichotomous outcome
        variable. We therefore estimate several logistic regression
        models [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. The logistic regression estimates
        the likelihood of occurrence of the outcome variable
        depending on different explanatory variables. The
        regression is described as:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="Xeq1">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} z_k = \alpha +
            \sum _{j=1}^J{\beta _j * X_{jk}}
            \end{equation}</span><br />
            <span class="equation-number">(1)</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>where <em>α</em> is the Y intercept, the <em>β</em>s are
        the regression coefficients, and the <em>X</em>s are a set
        of predictors. <em>α</em> and <em>β</em> are estimated by
        the maximum likelihood method.</p>
        <p>Modeling the likelihood of occurrence is not based on a
        linear regression approach but on a logistic function. It
        is given as:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="Xeq2">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} \pi (Y) =

        <p>Considering the discussion of features, we estimated the
        first model including solely the feature
        “<em>newuserratio</em>”, reflecting the engagement of
        previously passive users. Model 1 indicates that a post is
        more likely a <em>Buzz</em> when the numbers of newly
        active users interacting with it increases. It already
        exhibits a Pseudo <em>R</em> <sup>2</sup> of 0.2007 (cmp.
        Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab3">3</a>).</p>
        <p>When analyzing the results of the first model further,
        we discover that it indeed tends to classify certain posts
        of celebrities as well as live Q&amp;A sessions and
        lotteries as <em>Buzzes</em>. We hence extend the second
        model by the mean number of likes per comment
        (<em>commentlikes</em>) and the number of comments by the
        author of the original within the discussion
        (<em>authorcomments</em>). The results support this
        approach, the second model exhibits a slight positive
        correlation of the two features with the dependent
        variable, as well as a higher Pseudo <em>R</em>
        <sup>2</sup> of .25 and a slightly decreased BIC. Both
        underline the character of lively discussions, with more
        reactions on the given comments than in the case of
        non-<em>Buzzes</em>. Thus, we can state that by adding
        these two further features, we obtain better results for
        the classification of posts as <em>Buzzes</em>.</p>
        <p>To reflect the temporal character of short-lived
        activity at unexpected levels, we extend the third model by
        the number of posts during the most active hour of the
        discussion (<em>maxhourcomments</em>). The results
        initially seem counterintuitive, as this feature exhibits
        negative correlation to the dependent variable. It shows,
        however, that a <em>Buzz</em> receives a high number of
        comments throughout its entire time of existence, thus
        leading to low differences between the number of posts
        during peak and average hours. The discussion on other
        posts tends to exhibit more variance and hence more
        pronounced differences, yielding higher feature values.
        This fact is illustrated in Figure <a class="fig" href=
        "#fig1">1</a>. While activity on all posts is highest at
        the beginning, <em>Buzz</em>-activity is sustained for
        longer than non-<em>Buzz</em> activity, which tends to die
        out within a few hours. With Pseudo <em>R</em> <sup>2</sup>
        increasing and BIC decreasing we conclude that adding this
        feature helps improve the classification.</p>
        <p>We finally want to test if the overall activity contains
        supportive information. The <em>likes, shares, and
        comments</em> are all potential features for this purpose.
        However, testing them for collinearity, we find that they
        are not independent of each other and hence used each of
        them exclusively. These tests show that the number of
        comments has the highest explanatory power, and we hence
        add <em>comments</em> as a feature to Model 4. This fourth
        Model finally yields the highest Pseudo <em>R</em>
        <sup>2</sup> and the lowest BIC. It also reflects our
        definition nicely: it demonstrates that the overall direct
        and indirect activity and a constant high level of
        interaction with a post, which also attracts otherwise
        passive users are defining the <em>Buzz</em> phenomenon
        very well.</p>

        <p>Subsequently to this exploration, we apply the fourth
        model for an initial classification experiment on an
        additional, independent test set. This test set includes
        almost 24,000 posts with 20 <em>Buzzes</em>. Table
        <a class="tbl" href="#tab4">4</a> summarizes the
        results.</p>
        <p><em>π</em> acts as a threshold on the classification
        using the models from our logistic regression. Regarding
        various values of <em>π</em> for the experiments, we
        naturally obtain different classification results. Choosing
        a rather large <em>π</em> of 0.2, only eight
        <em>Buzzes</em> are identified, whereas twelve labeled
        <em>Buzzes</em> are mis-classified. Only six posts are
        falsely classified as <em>Buzzes</em>, although they are
        not labeled accordingly. Thus, a large <em>π</em> value
        yields a precision of over 50% and a recall of under
        50%.</p>
        <p>Choosing a small <em>π</em> of 0.01 on the other hand
        yields higher recall at lower precision: 16 out of 20
        <em>Buzzes</em> are correctly identified, which translates
        to a recall of 0.8. The number of false positives
        unfortunately is also rather high, which leads to a low
        precision of 0.14.</p>
        <p>This supports our expectation of a trade-off between
        identifying <em>Buzzes</em> correctly on the one hand, and
        a high number of false positive classifications on the
        other hand.</p>
        <p>Selecting an intermediate <em>π</em>-value of 0.05 leads
        to results that are better balanced. At 13 out of 20
        <em>Buzzes</em> detected correctly the recall is rather
        high at .65, and the number of false positives is
        comparatively lower with a precision of 0.43.</p>
        <p>As our data set entails an imbalance concerning
        <em>Buzzes</em> and non-<em>Buzzes</em> due to a true
        reflection of reality, we have to note that standard
        logistic regression is considered of only limited
        suitability for studies of such rare events. We hence also
        estimate a model using the “relogit” function [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], which
        is explicitly designed for such rare cases. However,
        comparing the respective results yields either identical
        quality or a slight bias towards higher recall and lower
        precision in the case of relogit. This comparison can be
        considered a test for robustness, and we conclude that even
        the results based on the ”logit” function are valid in
        general.</p>
        <p>The logistic regression provides great insight into the
        properties that <em>Buzzes</em> exhibit, and hence provides
        useful insights for decision makers and business analysts.
        Considering the classification results we obtained, we see
        that there is still some room for improvement.</p>

        using traditional grid search - a process of determining
        parameters through exhaustive search in a predetermined
        interval of possible hyperparameter values. We assigned a
        bias toward recall during this grid search, as avoiding
        false negatives is of higher priority than avoiding false
        positives due to <em>Buzz</em> rarity. In the case of
        Random Forests, we randomly selected a subset of 1,600
        non-<em>Buzzes</em> and averaged the results over a number
        of iterations, thus removing outlier results, to account
        for the fact that <em>Buzzes</em> are rare events.</p>
        <p>Training Random Forests, the results on optimized
        parameters showed that the most relevant features are
        <em>comments, postlikes, postshares, firstlevel, replies,
        users, newusers, repeatusers, pagelikes</em> and
        <em>extremas</em>. This again reflects our definition of a
        <em>Buzz</em> being a post with high activity and the
        observation of an engagement of otherwise passive
        users.</p>
        <p>AdaBoost and SVMs used all available data and features,
        with scaled parameters.</p>

          Limitations</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Without contradicting previous statements or inhibiting
      the validity of our results, certain restrictions apply to
      the methods and results used in this paper. The limitations
      mentioned here are as exhaustive as we are aware.</p>
      <p>Selecting Facebook pages with a higher likelihood of
      <em>Buzzes</em> occurring introduces a bias to the dataset
      where the number of <em>Buzzes</em> is overrepresented. This
      prevents us from using the data to deduce the overall
      prevalence of a <em>Buzz</em>, but should have no impact on
      the classification model.</p>
      <p>In addition to the page selection, using a single OSN may
      raise concerns about the universal applicability of our
      results. It could be argued, for instance, that other OSNs
      may offer additional dimensions of data or present different
      correlations due to a different modus operandi (e.g., Twitter
      functioning very differently and possibly inducing different
      behavior). While it is true that more data from more sources
      would likely improve our results, choosing to base our
      features solely on metadata allows us some generality and
      Facebook enjoys the most widespread adoption among OSNs. It
      thus offers by far the largest user base and to the best of
      our knowledge its audience is no less representative of the
      online community than other OSNs’.</p>
      <p>Beside the choices we made for the source of our data, the
      amount of data is always a possible point of contention as
      well. Despite the large amount of data we gathered, we were
      only able to identify a small number of <em>Buzzes</em>, a
      result of their rarity. In this case a small sample size
      could not be avoided and our results do show high
      significance.</p>
      <p>Another concern we wish to address here is the choice of
      features, specifically the fact that we restricted ourselves
      to metadata. Facebook not only exhibits rich thread data in
      public pages, but also an extensive amount of structural and
      content data. However, Facebook does not offer easy access to
      said data, specifically structural data is difficult to
      acquire. This not only limits our efforts in retrieving such
      data, it also makes our results less applicable as others
      will likely not have ready access to such data either.
      Content related data, on the other hand, opens a number of
      complexity dimensions that are difficult and resource
      intensive to interpret, again restricting the applicability
      of our results and also yielding an entirely different
      contribution. Our goal in restricting ourselves to metadata,
      then, is primarily to offer usable results both for future
      research and applications.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">6</span> Conclusion</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>This paper deals with <em>Buzzes</em> – phenomena rooted
      in social media, where posts receive extraordinary attention
      over a short period of time. <em>Buzzes</em> have frequently
      been observed and discussed in media, but never been defined
      or analyzed scientifically, to the best of our knowledge.
      Observing that <em>Buzzes</em> have exceptional influence on
      public discourse and opinion, we assert that their early
      detection is desirable to help prevent brand damage or even
      vilification of individuals and institutions. It may also aid
      marketing campaigns to detect and leverage positive
      <em>Buzzes</em>.</p>
      <p>Upon discussing a suitable definition of <em>Buzzes</em>
      in relation to similar phenomena, we analyzed <em>Buzzes</em>
      on Facebook.</p>
      <p>Collecting and annotating a large dataset of over 100,000
      posts from 76 Facebook pages, we used logistic regression
      solely on the metadata of the posts to identify features that
      define, and can help classify posts as <em>Buzzes</em>. The
      results indicate that <em>Buzzes</em> indeed are
      characterized by intense activity over short periods of time
      – which varies from generally popular discussion, or
      <em>trends</em>, in the engagement of otherwise passive users
      and a rather constant activity over time (features
      <em>comments</em>, <em>newusersratio</em>,
      <em>commentlikes</em>, and <em>maxhourcomments</em>).</p>
      <p>Understanding the characteristics of <em>Buzzes</em>, we
      subsequently aimed at providing better early detection by
      training well-known classifiers. We provided them with the
      overall collection of features, as opposed to the manual
      selection for logistic regression. It hence turned out that
      the number of shares and likes a post receives compared to
      the average of posts on the same Facebook page helps enhance
      the classification. Training Random Forests and SVM using
      grid search immediately yielded better recall, and applying
      Adaptive Boosting led to the best results (measured using
      <em>F</em>1 scores).</p>
      <p>We see a variety of venues to extend our work in the
      future. Having focused on Facebook pages within this paper,
      we shall explore its applicability to consider more
      structural data, including the posts and ego networks of
      individuals. Also the applicability to other social media,
      like for instance Twitter, Instagram, and G+ raises
      interesting questions. First, it will help to validate the
      phenomenon and our approach, and it may also disclose the
      similarities and differences of the characteristics of
      discussion on different sites, focusing on different types of
      content. Finally, we are currently working on live, rather
      than the post-hoc detection of <em>Buzzes</em>.</p>
