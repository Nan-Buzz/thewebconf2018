        <p><small>In cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-impression (CPM) advertising campaigns, advertisers always run the risk of spending the budget without getting enough conversions. Moreover, the bidding on advertising inventory has few connections with propensity that can reach to cost-per-acquisition (CPA) goals. To address this problem, this paper presents a bid optimization scenario to achieve the desired CPA goals for advertisers. In particular, we build the optimization engine to make a decision by solving the constrained optimization problem. The proposed model can naturally recommend the bid that meets the advertisers’ expectations by making inference over history auction behaviors. The bid optimization model outperforms the baseline methods on real-world campaigns, and can be applied into a wide range of scenarios for performance improvement and revenue liftup.</small></p>

      <p>Online advertising uses the internet to deliver the promotional marketing messages provided by advertisers to consumers on the publisher platform by integrating the advertisements into its online content. Bid optimization is a technique to optimize the bidding process, which allows the advertiser to bid for winning the impressions and clicks. The effective and efficient bidding strategies have been proposed to bring more benefits for advertisers, consumes and third-party platforms. For example, for the same key word “buy jeans”, there is 20 conversions with 2 CPC bid for advertiser 1 but only 5 conversions with the same price for advertiser 2. To effectively learn the useful ”signals” available for bid adjustment for advertisers, we build effective models to capture what the cost and win rate will look like if the advertisers change the bidding price.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we focus on cost per acquisition (CPA) goal, which helps the advertisers programmatically choose the best “smart” bid, and then derive the most possible scale for the targets, which in turn, acquires more traffic for e-commerce business. We present an effective way to automatically set bids for auctions to get as many conversions as possible within the target CPA goals. Then we can recommend bid to advertisers for adjustment based on how likely a click is to lead to a conversion. It therefore can help advertisers to plan CPA goals and revenue targeting. We believe all the algorithm advancement can bring in more predictive signals and better target accuracy compared to inflection point&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>], portfolio optimization&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] and etc. Compared to CPA, cost per mille impressions (CPM)<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> poses high risk on the conversions, cost per sale (CPS) ignores the value of click which potentially provides worse traffic liquidating, and cost per click (CPC) controls the cost of clicks after running page views without giving enough attention to the true conversions that may actually bring in revenue increases for advertisers.</p>

        </div>
      </figure>
      <p><strong>An illustrative example</strong>. Let's say the advertiser is measuring sales for several online electronic stores by optimizing the bids based on the value of a shopping cart in total. The goal is 50 per conversation (that leads to sales) based on every dollar one spends on ads. If one is setting a target CPA goal as <font style="normal">$</font>50 - for every <font style="normal">$</font>50 you spend on ads, you'd like to get 1 conversion (and get the corresponding revenue based on conversion value). More concretely,</p>
      <p>Store 1: <font style="normal">$</font>100 in spend ÷ 2 conversions = <font style="normal">$</font>50 CPA goal</p>
      <p>Store 2: <font style="normal">$</font>150 in spend ÷ 4 conversions = <font style="normal">$</font>37.5 CPA goal</p>
      <p>Store 3: <font style="normal">$</font>500 in spend ÷ 5 conversions = <font style="normal">$</font>100 CPA goal</p>
      <p>Based on these data one would decide to spend more budget at store 1 and store 2, as one is hitting the goal on these websites. At store 3, the advertiser pays the double of the goal per conversion, so the campaign will stop bidding there.</p>
      <p><strong>Optimization Goal</strong> A question that naturally follows is: <em>how to set the bid price in order to achieve these CPA goals?</em> More formally, given the CPA goal with value <em>C</em>, we aim to provide the bid recommendation that can maximize the clicks while considering CPA goal for the advertiser <em>i</em>, <em>i.e.,</em></p>
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq1">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\begin{eqnarray} &amp; \max _{\text{bid}}Click(bid); \;\;\; s.t \;\;\;\; CPA(bid) = C; \end{eqnarray}</span><br />
          <span class="equation-number">(1)</span>
        </div>
      </div>where <em>click</em>(<em>bid</em>) denotes the number of clicks the advertiser can obtain given the bidding price at <em>bid</em>, <em>CPA</em>(<em>bid</em>) tells the CPA goal one can achieve with bidding price <em>bid</em><a class="fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Algorithm Workflow</strong></p>
      <p><strong>(i) Get all supply impressions</strong></p>
      <p>In performance buying scenarios, number of impression one can get from the inventory is determined by a combination of the content of the site and a specific campaign's creative and targeting, which is proportional to the available number of impressions on the particular publisher, goe location and targeting attribution settings.</p>
      <p><strong>(ii) Click and Conversion prediction</strong></p>
      <p>Translating Goals of CPA into click and conversion number prediction is necessary for advertisers, because advertisers typically pay for a particular user response via a cost-per-click (CPC) or CPM. More formally,</p>
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq2">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\begin{eqnarray} &amp; Click(bid) = Impression \times Win rate(bid) \times pCTR, \end{eqnarray}</span><br />
          <span class="equation-number">(2)</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq3">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\begin{eqnarray} &amp; Conversion(bid) = Click(bid) \times pCVR , \end{eqnarray}</span><br />
          <span class="equation-number">(3)</span>
        </div>
      </div>where <em>Click</em>(<em>bid</em>) tells the number of click the advertiser can obtain at <em>bid</em> price, <em>Impression</em> is the available impressions based on the combination of publisher and targeting information. <em>Winrate</em>(<em>bid</em>) is the winning ratio from all available impressions, <em>Conversion</em>(<em>bid</em>) is the number of conversions obtained at price <em>bid</em>, <em>pCTR</em>, <em>pCVR</em> are the predicted click-through-rate (CTR)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] and predicted conversion-rate (CVR) for the particular advertiser based on history campaigns.
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>(iii) CPA optimization for bid</strong></p>
      <p>The CPA goal is transformed into CPC bids based on a variety of factors, including historical win rates for a particular type of impression, and actual cost at that bid price. For example, if the historical rates indicate that the win rate is low, then a lower bid will be submitted. On the other hand, if the response rate is high, then a higher bid will be submitted. More formally,</p>
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq4">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\begin{eqnarray} CPA(bid) &amp;=&amp; \frac{Spend(bid)}{Conversion(bid)} =\frac{Click(bid) \times CPC\_cost(bid)}{Click(bid) \times pCVR} \nonumber \\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{CPC\_cost(bid)}{pCVR} = \frac{eCPM\_cost(bid)}{1000 \times pCTR \times pCVR}, \end{eqnarray}</span><br />
          <span class="equation-number">(4)</span>

          <h2><span class="section-number">3</span> Experiment</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Given the fact that we only know the ground-truth for the current bid, <em>i.e.,</em> the true number of conversions and the true spend for current campaign at current bid price, we therefore design experiments to compare the differences between the true CPA (denoted as CPA) and the forecasted CPA (denoted as <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\hat{CPA}$</span></span> ) at current bid. More formally, we use the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) as the measurement, <em>i.e.,</em> <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\text{MAPE} = \sum _{i=1}^n \frac{ |{y}_i- \hat{y_i}| }{y_i}, \;\;\; \text{RMSPE} = \sqrt {\frac{1}{n}\sum _{i=1}^n{ (\frac{\hat{y_i}-y_i}{y_i}})^2},$</span></span> where <em>y<sub>i</sub></em> is the CPA for ads campaign <em>i</em> with current bid <em>b<sub>i</sub></em> , and <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\hat{y}_i$</span></span> is the forecasted CPA for campaign <em>i</em> at current bid <em>b<sub>i</sub></em> . The smaller values of MAPE, RMSPE indicate better performance. We also compare the baselines: <strong>(a) Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS).</strong> If the observed bid price exists in history, then we retrieve the corresponding CPA computed using spend and conversion in history. Otherwise, we use the nearest neighbor method to predict the CPA. For the observed bid <em>b</em>, if <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$b^{\prime }_i$</span></span> is the nearest neighbor of bid <em>b<sub>i</sub></em> in history, then we retrieve the corresponding CPA for bid <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$b^{\prime }_i$</span></span> as the predicted CPA; <strong>(b) Linear interpolation (LI)</strong> The idea is to use linear interpolation in historical bid price to predict CPA correspondingly<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Table. &nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> shows the performance evaluation on observed 190,876 ad campaigns. Given that it is a challenging task to predict CPA for diversified, fluctuated ad campaigns, the result obtained using proposed model is competitive and reasonable, because it leverages all history information completely by smartly setting the bid price. Fig. <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> shows the example of ad campaigns with forecasted CPA, total money of spend and number of clicks at different bid prices.</p>
