        <p><small>Large-scale online civic engagements (OCEs) with
        more than 100 participants have become possible due to
        recent developments in online social media technology. OCEs
        have the potential to achieve consensus building and
        collective decision-making with a large number of citizens,
        which is difficult to achieve in face-to-face contexts.
        However, most users in a large-scale OCE are rarely
        constantly active. Therefore, an important problem for the
        activation of a large-scale OCE is to facilitate the
        discussion by predicting which citizens will have
        significant influence in the discussion.</small></p>
        <p><small>This paper examines the activation prediction
        problem in a large-scale OCE. We propose a novel influence
        model based on the impulse response of activity histories
        and argumentative pressures, as well as an effective
        testing algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate
        that the proposed models with impulse response and the
        lexical pressures show better accuracy compared with
        baselines. In addition, the testing time required by the
        proposed method can be reduced significantly by employing a
        node-cutting algorithm.</small></p>

      <p>Online civic engagements (OCEs) are attracting significant
      attention because through OCEs, a large number of citizens
      can discuss various issues without time, place, or age
      restrictions. In an OCE, large-scale topic-centered transient
      discussions have become common in recent years. However,
      support tools are necessary to facilitate discussions in
      large-scale OCE forums effectively [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>]. OCEs are also a powerful
      way to gather different perspectives about an issue in a
      short period [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>], and they have the potential to
      achieve consensus building and collective decision-making
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>]. In
      addition, some epoch-making large-scale synchronous
      discussions [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>] and
      relevance studies have been reported.</p>
      <p>Similar to face-to-face civic engagements, one key factor
      to a successful OCE is the participation of numerous
      citizens. However, most citizens in a large-scale OCE are
      rarely constantly active [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>]. Therefore, one problem in a
      large-scale OCE is the prediction of which citizens will
      become active [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]. In contrast, there are few
      theoretical approaches to civic engagement [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>] even though citizen
      activation prediction is an interesting field of study.
      Therefore, we propose an influence prediction method to solve
      the activation prediction problem for a large-scale OCE.
      Predicting the activation probability of each citizen is
      expected to be applied to automatic OCE facilitation,
      maximizing the effectiveness of discussions and consensus
      building.</p>
      <p>There are two key assumptions relative to the influence
      model and activation prediction method in a large-scale OCE.
      First, we assume that a large-scale OCE is an interest-based
      weak-tie (partially strong tie) network. Herein, the original
      discussion platform provides a single discussion stream and
      no apparent strong-tie properties such as Facebook while it
      includes some sort of strong-tie properties (i.e., threads).
      In general, only a few citizens participate in in each
      discussion thread, which is similar to a strong-tie. This
      characteristic helps us model influence diffusion because
      weak-tie networks can promote collective action more
      effectively [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>].
      Second, we follow the groundbreaking work into activation
      prediction by Goyal et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>] because research into learning
      influence probabilities for a large-scale OCE is highly
      limited, and one possible way to approach such research is by
      applying the techniques of well-established theories. Goyal
      et al. assumed a general threshold model and proposed a
      method to learn influence probabilities and predict
      activation using the general threshold model from datasets of
      online social networks and media; however, OCEs were not
      their primary focus. Their propagation framework introduced
      <em>Active</em> and <em>Inactive</em> states for a node.
      Here, <em>Active</em> means that the user has already
      performed some action and <em>Inactive</em> means that the
      user has not performed the same action and is expected to be
      active in the future. While Goyal's model [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] primarily focused on
      static and time-dependent models to primarily capture
      influence, influence probability techniques can consider
      other elements such as user preferences. Therefore, we
      introduce the social science concept that strong-tie
      properties provide the social pressure required for behavior
      adoption [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>]
      to the Goyal's model.</p>
      <p>Our primary contribution is a method to model an influence
      framework for the OCE platform. In addition, we demonstrate
      how influence probabilities can be learned or predicted.
      Initially, we define an inter-participant argumentative
      “strength” employing a preference event as a certain
      strong-tie hypothesis and active probability (impulse
      response). Then, methods to estimate the influence
      probability among participants are proposed. Note that the
      impulse response, common preferences, and lexical preference
      are considered when predicting influence probability.
      Moreover, the proposed method is evaluated relative to
      activation prediction accuracies using original datasets of a
      large-scale OCE. This OCE was held from the end of 2016 to
      the beginning of 2017 using the original <em>COLLAGREE</em>
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>] discussion
      tool, and it included more than 800 citizens discussing the
      topic “The charm of Nagoya City.”</p>
      <p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
      First, we describe related research in Section 2. We then
      formalize the large-scale OCE problem in Section 3. In
      Section 4, we propose methods to predict the influence
      probabilities of inter-participants, and in Section 5, we
      propose a testing algorithm to remove unnecessary nodes. The
      proposed methods are evaluated and compared to baselines in
      Section 6. Finally, we present conclusions in Section 7.</p>

      <p>Due to recent developments in online social networks
      (OSNs), analysis of OSN user relationships and the
      propagation models of information and claims have received
      increasing attention [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. It is important to detect nodes
      with high centrality [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>] and the center of information
      diffusion in social networks. However, centrality cannot
      effectively reveal the connections among users because it
      cannot consider diffusibility in a social network. Therefore,
      various studies into information diffusion models have been
      conducted. For example, the pioneering contributions to
      diffusion model research are independent cascade
      (IC)[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]
      and linear threshold (LT)[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>].</p>
      <p>Our primary goal is to control a network by spreading
      influence at the lowest cost or conversely by suppressing a
      specific influence such as flaming. Chen et al. [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] conducted
      groundbreaking research into controlling influences. Note
      that modeling influence probability between nodes is required
      to maximize influence. Although the IC and LT models are
      quite simple and powerful, they do not consider influence
      probability estimation based on data. Therefore, even though
      such models may be theoretically sound, they are impractical
      for our purposes. Recently, several studies have tackled such
      a problem [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>].</p>
      <p>In addition, agent-based modeling approaches have been
      proposed in combination with social network analyses
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>]. For
      example, one study focused on long-term influence maintenance
      in agent-based models, which was applied to control arguments
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>].</p>
      <p>We also focus on data utilization, including natural
      languages. In terms of natural language processing, Rowe et
      al. examined the prediction of influence probabilities
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>]. Their
      method applied lexical features to the analysis of the
      influence of terrorists. In their study, they considered the
      specific words of a terrorist group, and an adaptation
      probability of the words was applied to influence
      prediction.</p>

        <p>In this paper, as an analogy for general forums, a post
        and a thread, i.e., a collection of posts, are considered
        as forum elements. We first apply the influence model
        proposed by Goyal et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] to the forum elements. In their
        study, Goyal et al. defined <em>Active</em> as meaning a
        user has already entered a specific group. Accordingly, we
        define <em>Active</em> to mean that a user has already
        posted a comment to a specific thread. This assumption is
        justified because reaching critical mass is more likely
        when networks of like-minded individuals (e.g., users in a
        same thread) are activated [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>]. In our problem setting,
        activation prediction is the prediction of “whether a user
        will join an arbitrary thread.”</p>
        <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> illustrates an
        influence model of an OCE platform comprising a thread and
        its users. Herein, the user who generated a discussion
        thread is defined as the <em>Initiator</em>, users who post
        to the thread are <em>Active</em>, and users who have never
        posted to the thread are <em>Inactive</em>. As can be seen,
        <em>Inactive</em> nodes are affected by neighboring
        <em>Initiator</em> and <em>Active</em> nodes. The social
        pressure received by <em>Inactive</em> nodes increases as
        more people post to the thread.</p>

        <p>We introduce the general threshold model to predict
        whether a user will join a thread. Given an undirected OCE
        graph <em>G</em> = (<em>V</em>, <em>E</em>), where
        <em>V</em> denotes the user node set and <em>E</em> is the
        edge set of each node, the graph that represents the social
        ties of each user at timestamp <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\forall t \in \mathbb
        {N}$</span></span> is expressed as follows:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <div class="display-equation">

            \right\rbrace , \nonumber \\E^{(t)}&amp;=\left\lbrace
            (v_i,v_j) \in E \mid t \ge jo(v_i) \wedge t \ge jo(v_j)

          </div>
        </div>where <em>jo</em>(<em>v</em>) represents the
        timestamp of when the user registered on the OCE platform.
        Herein, for simplicity, we assume that social ties are
        never broken. Then, we introduce an activation probability
        of <em>Inactive</em> node <em>v</em>. This activation
        probability represents the probability of an
        <em>Inactive</em> user posting a comment to a given thread.
        Using a set <em>S<sub>v</sub></em> ⊂<em>V</em>
        <sup>(<em>t</em>)</sup> of the contiguous
        <em>Initiator</em> and <em>Active</em> neighbors of
        <em>v</em>, the activation probability
        <em>P<sub>a</sub></em> (<em>v</em>) is defined as follows:
        <p></p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="eq1">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} P_{a}(v) = 1 -
            \prod _{u \in S_v} \left(1 - p_{u \rightarrow v}

            <span class="equation-number">(3.2)</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>where <em>p</em> <sub><em>u</em> → <em>v</em></sub> is
        the influence probability from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>.
        Since <em>P<sub>a</sub></em> (<em>v</em>) is a
        complementary event of the joint probability that all
        neighbors will fail to activate <em>v</em>, it is a
        probability to activate <em>v</em> with factor of her
        neighbor nodes.</p>
        <p>The main technical contribution of this paper is the
        prediction of influence probabilities <em>p</em>
        <sub><em>u</em> → <em>v</em></sub> . There are several
        approaches to learning an influence probability; however,
        most existing methods cannot utilize the properties of a
        large-scale OCE. For example, Figure <a class="fig" href=
        "#fig2">2</a> shows the aggregate delay time in 5 min from
        the latest activity (e.g., voting <em>like</em> or browsing
        of each user that performed at least one activity to the
        time at which a post was made to an unrelated thread).
        Herein, the fact that many citizens are inactive 20 minutes
        after the latest activity is confirmed. This property
        differs from the existing offline civic engagements.
        Therefore, we introduce active probability, which
        represents whether each user is active at the time of
        thread creation (<em>initiation</em>), where we define
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$act_{v}^{(t)}$</span></span> as an event in which
        user <em>v</em> is active at time <em>t</em>.</p>

        <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> shows that the
        delay time to post on a thread after the latest activity
        decays exponentially. Therefore, users’ activities can be
        considered as a discrete-time signal process. Concretely,
        the activities are considered to be the input to a linear
        time-invariant system and the response function is an
        exponential decay function whose parameter is learned.</p>
        <p>Before we describe our problem formalization, we define
        the activity, i.e., voting <em>like</em> or browsing, set
        of <em>v</em> as <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$A_v = \bigcup _{i = 1}^{N_v} \lbrace
        a^{(v)}_i\rbrace$</span></span> . Note that
        <em>N<sub>v</sub></em> is the number of actions of
        <em>v</em> in the dataset. We define <em>A</em>
        <sub><em>v</em>, <em>t</em></sub> , which is a set of
        activities of <em>v</em> from <em>t</em> −
        <em>T<sub>limit</sub></em> to <em>t</em>, as follows:</p>

          </div>
        </div>We denote the timestamp of activity element

        <em>T<sub>limit</sub></em> is a hyperparameter that
        prevents the activity history of <em>v</em> from being
        traced infinitely, which makes the model fast and simple.
        Then, we present an exponential decay that is a
        modification of the discrete model [<a class="bib"

        activity timestamp of <em>v</em> before <em>t</em>. Note
        that the active probability cannot be predicted if
        <em>v</em> never performs an activity, providing it as 0.
        Herein, <em>τ<sub>v</sub></em> is a trainable parameter
        that is learned for each node because the activities of
        users vary. However, the learning results of
        <em>τ<sub>v</sub></em> are overfitted when discussions do
        not proceed to a satisfactory extent due to a lack of
        activity history samples for each node. Therefore, we solve
        this problem by learning the average response time of all
        users who have posts and activity histories. Thus,

        threads in the dataset. We denote the timestamp of the
        <em>initiation</em> of thread <em>d</em> as
        <em>T</em>(<em>d</em>). In addition, <span class=

        where <em>N</em> <sub><em>v</em>, <em>d</em></sub> is the
        number of posts of <em>v</em> in <em>d</em>. The numerator
        of equation (<a class="eqn" href="#eq4">3</a>) represents
        how many response delays are observed, and the denominator
        is the cumulative sum of the response delays. Therefore,
        <em>τ<sub>v</sub></em> represents the average response time
        of all users who have posts and activity histories. We

      <p>In this section, we describe our testing algorithm. Note
      that the training algorithms are omitted because they are
      self-explanatory for each equation (<a class="eqn" href=
      "#eq4">3</a>), (<a class="eqn" href="#eq7">4</a>) and
      (<a class="eqn" href="#eq9">6</a>). Our testing algorithm is
      based on the evaluation algorithm proposed by Goyal et al.
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. This
      testing process predicts who will perform an action among
      neighboring <em>Active</em> nodes at each time step. In the
      proposed model, this means who will join a thread due to the
      social pressures of <em>Active</em> nodes. We also propose an
      effective testing algorithm to eliminate unnecessary nodes by
      calculating the impulse response demands within the range of
      <em>T<sub>limit</sub></em> .</p>

      <p>Algorithm 1 shows our testing algorithm with cutting for
      an activation prediction. At line 6, the loop for each
      <em>p</em> of the posts in <em>d</em> in chronological order
      is conducted. Here, <em>v</em> is the poster node of
      <em>p</em> (line 7). The Boolean <em>perform<sub>v</sub></em>
      becomes 1 if <em>v</em> is already stored in the
      <em>table</em>; <em>v</em> is <em>Active</em> (lines 8-9).
      Otherwise, (<em>v</em>, <em>perform<sub>v</sub></em> = 2,
      <em>p<sub>v</sub></em> = 0) is added to the <em>table</em>
      because <em>v</em> is an <em>Initiator</em> (line 11). Then,
      the loop with each <em>u</em>, i.e., <em>v</em>’s neighbor,
      is run. The proposed method can remove users that are beyond
      the range of <em>T<sub>limit</sub></em> before
      <em>T</em>(<em>d</em>) (line 13). The <em>table</em> is
      converted to a list of tuples with
      <em>perform<sub>u</sub></em> and <em>p<sub>u</sub></em> .
      Note that the probability of <em>act<sub>u</sub></em> at time
      <em>T</em>(<em>d</em>) must be estimated (line 17) to observe
      their activation probability at thread initiation. The list
      of tuples comprises pairs of the correct label and the
      probabilistic score. Here, <em>u</em> is posted to the thread
      and becomes <em>Active</em> when a correct label is
      <em>perform<sub>u</sub></em> = 1. The score represents the
      probability to be <em>Active</em> (lines 22–24).</p>

        <p>In our experiments, users with no posts were removed. As
        a result, the dataset contained 204 users. This dataset was
        then divided into training and test sets
        (|<em>D<sup>train</sup></em> |: |<em>D<sup>test</sup></em>
        | = 8: 2). The precision-recall (PR) curves of positive
        cases were plotted after executing multiple training and
        test iterations for each model. Herein, a positive case
        means a plot indicating <em>perform<sub>u</sub></em> = 1 in

        <p>As mentioned previously, in a large-scale OCE, most
        citizens post infrequently. In other words, prediction
        accuracy between citizens who post frequently and those who
        post infrequently differ significantly. Therefore, we
        evaluated the PR curves of users with a number of posts
        that was greater than or equal to a given threshold. Note
        that this threshold (i.e., the minimum number of posts) is
        referred to as <strong>discussion density</strong>. The
        range of discussion density is from 1 to 20, which is
        sufficient.</p>

        <p>The PR curves of the random baseline and models with
        preference probability only are shown in Figure 5a . Figure
        5b shows the PR curves of the proposed models. As can be
        seen, accuracy is low. This is common, however, in social
        influence prediction because behaviors are complex and
        difficult to spread [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>]. Thus, the AUC scores of the
        proposed methods (<strong>WSS</strong>,
        <strong>MLE*ACT</strong>, and <strong>WSS*ACT</strong>)
        should be compared to the AUC scores of the baselines
        (<strong>MLE</strong> and random) because the proposed
        models can predict highly influential citizens more
        accurately compared to the baselines.</p>
        <p>As shown in Figure 5b, only <strong>ACT</strong>
        demonstrates poor performance in terms of AUC. However, the
        methods that combine <strong>MLE</strong>,
        <strong>WSS</strong>, and <strong>CPS</strong> with
        <strong>ACT</strong> (<strong>MLE*ACT</strong>,
        <strong>WSS*ACT</strong>, and <strong>CPS*ACT</strong>,
        respectively) demonstrate better performance than the other
        proposed methods. This means that our proposed influence
        model for a large-scale OCE is effective because the
        proposed models (which consider common preferences and
        textual information) are more effective when the impulse
        response is incorporated.</p>

        <p>To demonstrate that estimation accuracies differ
        significantly according to discussion density, we compared

        discussion density increases because the classification
        becomes easier as the number of users decreases. In
        addition, an increasing activity history per user
        simplifies the prediction process. Figures 7a and 7b show
        the PR curves obtained with a discussion density of 10. As
        can be seen, the proposed <strong>WSS*ACT</strong> and
        <strong>MLE*ACT</strong> methods outperform the baselines
        significantly when the discussion density is high, which

        applications as opposed to the time required for
        training.</p>
        <p>Figure 8b shows that the runtime of the proposed method

        <p>As shown in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig9">9</a>,
        there is a tradeoff among <em>T<sub>limit</sub></em> ,
        execution time, and accuracy. Execution time and accuracy
        improves as <em>T<sub>limit</sub></em> increases up to
        <em>T<sub>limit</sub></em> = 25. Furthermore, accuracy does
        not increase even if <em>T<sub>limit</sub></em> is greater
        than 25, at which time the active probability intuitively
        comes close to 0, as shown in Figure <a class="fig" href=
        "#fig2">2</a>.</p>
        <p>However, we assume that when the forum has a long decay
        time, improving accuracy requires significant execution
        time. However, we could not locate large-scale OCE
        discussion data with a long decay time. In both cases,
        setting <em>T<sub>limit</sub></em> properly can reduce
        testing time and improve accuracy.</p>

      <p>In this paper, we have demonstrated how an influence model
      can be applied to activation prediction for large-scale OCE.
      Specifically, we have shown how to model an OCE's properties
      and argumentative strength in the network. For example, the
      active probability of citizens declines exponentially, which
      results in the introduction of an impulse response with an
      exponential decay function. In addition, the proposed model
      considers strong-tie pressures such as preference probability
      based on CPS and word specificities. The experimental results
      demonstrate that the activation prediction accuracy of the
      proposed models outperforms the baselines: random baseline
      and Goyal et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] method. Moreover, the proposed
      method was remarkably effective for extremely active online
      discussions. In addition, by employing the node-cutting
      algorithm, the proposed models reduced testing time
      significantly compared with a baseline.</p>
      <p>Possible future work includes improving influence
      probability accuracy by considering the semantic contexts of
      posts. It may be possible to obtain accurate influence
      probabilities by employing natural language processing to
      analyze the semantics of posts. We will also consider
      applying the proposed models to an influence maximization
      problem and the construction of automatic facilitation
      systems.</p>
