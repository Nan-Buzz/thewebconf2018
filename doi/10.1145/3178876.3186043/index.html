        <p><small>Our work bridges the literature on
        incentive-compatible mechanism design and the literature on
        diffusion algorithms. We introduce the study of finding an
        incentive-compatible (strategy-proof) mechanism for
        selecting an influential vertex in a directed graph (e.g.
        Twitter's network). The goal is to devise a mechanism with
        a bounded ratio between the maximal influence and the
        influence of the selected user, and in which no user can
        improve its probability of being selected by following or
        unfollowing other users. We introduce the <em>Two Path</em>
        mechanism which is based on the idea of selecting the
        vertex that is the first intersection of two independent
        random walks in the network. The Two Path mechanism is
        incentive compatible on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and
        has a finite approximation ratio on natural subfamilies of
        DAGs. Simulations indicate that this mechanism is suitable
        for practical uses.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>

      </header>
      <p>The problem of selecting influential users in a network,
      has been extensively studied in the past decade ([<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]). These
      works mainly focus on the problem of maximizing diffusion in
      a <em>given</em> network. If we assume that users of the
      network are willing to be selected by the mechanism, it is
      desirable that the selection mechanism will not only have
      good diffusion performance, but also be <em>incentive
      compatible</em>; namely, that a user could not affect his
      probability of being selected by strategic erasure (or
      formation) of links. For instance, suppose that Twitter would
      like to start a new epidemic trend. It would like to find a
      very influential user and give him some benefit in order to
      kickoff its campaign. If the users are aware of these
      intents, they might remove or add out-going links in order to
      get chosen. A similar problem would be to select an academic
      paper in a particular field and awarding it as ‘the most
      influential’ in this field; measuring the influence according
      to quotes from other papers and taking into account both
      direct and propagated influence.</p>
      <p>The following simple example demonstrates the tendency
      between diffusion maximization and incentive
      compatibility.</p>
      <p><img src=
      "../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186043/images/www2018-52-img1.svg"
      class="img-responsive" alt="" longdesc="" /></p>
      <p>A directed edge from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em> indicates
      that <em>u</em> follows (or cites) <em>v</em>. In any
      plausible diffusion model, the most influential vertex in
      network <em>G</em> <sub>1</sub> is <em>A</em>, while the most
      influential vertex in network <em>G</em> <sub>2</sub> is
      <em>C</em>. Suppose the mechanism simply selects the most
      influential vertex. Then user <em>C</em>, knowing that the
      network is <em>G</em> <sub>1</sub>, might have an incentive
      not to follow user <em>A</em> (although she is interested in
      user's <em>A</em> content) in order to be selected by the
      mechanism.</p>
      <p>As a first step towards understanding incentive compatible
      diffusion mechanisms, our main focus in this paper is on the
      problem of selecting a single user when the graph is acyclic.
      Note that in environments where users arrive in horological
      order (e.g., scientific papers or scale-free networks; see,
      for example, [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]) acyclic graphs are indeed a good
      proxy for the actual environment.</p>
      <p>One of the simplest ideas to develop mechanisms (hopefully
      incentive compatible) that select vertices with (hopefully)
      high diffusion is the following: choose a node <em>v</em>
      <sub>1</sub> (at random) and ask him to mention a single user
      <em>v</em> <sub>2</sub> that he follows. Informally speaking,
      by arguments in the spirit of the friendship paradox
      ([<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>]), we
      expect that <em>v</em> <sub>2</sub> will have better
      diffusion than <em>v</em> <sub>1</sub>. We can then ask
      <em>v</em> <sub>2</sub> who is his friend, etcetera. Thus,
      proceeding along a path increases (in expectation) the
      influence of the observed user. Two obstacles arise with this
      idea:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="•">When do we stop the
        process?<br /></li>
        <li id="list2" label="•">What if a node reports that he
        does not follow anyone?<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id=
        "foot-fn2"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <em>Two Path</em> mechanism that we suggest is based
      on this simple idea, but instead of tracking a single path,
      it tracks two. Regarding the first obstacle, we now have a
      natural candidate for the selected user — the first
      intersection of the two paths. Regarding the second obstacle,
      if both paths have ended without intersecting, we simply
      re-execute the process with a modification that all the
      already tracked users cannot be selected (this is needed for
      the incentive compatibility). Note that the (informally)
      presented mechanism is very simple for implementation in
      practical settings and it requires only partial knowledge
      about the network (i.e., full revelation of information by
      all users is not needed).</p>
      <p>Our results are as follows. In Proposition&nbsp;<a class=
      "enc" href="#enc5">3.1</a> we show that the Two Path
      mechanism is indeed incentive compatible on DAGs. In
      Theorem&nbsp;<a class="enc" href="#enc7">3.3</a> we show that
      the Two Path mechanism performs very well on trees and
      achieves an approximation ratio of 1.5. In
      Theorem&nbsp;<a class="enc" href="#enc8">3.4</a> we show that
      for forests which are <em>balanced</em> (see
      Definition&nbsp;<a class="enc" href="#enc9">3.5</a>) the Two
      Path mechanism achieves a constant approximation
      ratio<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
      "foot-fn3"><sup>2</sup></a>. However, on DAGs (even
      balanced), the Two Path mechanism might not perform so well,
      as demonstrated in Example&nbsp;<a class="enc" href=
      "#enc12">4.1</a>. In Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-14">4</a> we develop a mechanism that is based on the
      analysis of the distribution induced by Two Path, and achieve
      a constant approximation ratio for DAGs that are both
      balanced, and <em>monotone</em> (i.e., DAGs in which a user
      is always more influential than his followers; see Theorem
      <a class="enc" href="#enc15">4.4</a>). In
      Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-15">5</a> we extend
      the Two Path mechanism to an incentive-compatible mechanism
      for general networks. Test results of this extension and of
      the Two Path mechanism on simulated scale-free graphs are
      presented in Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-16">6</a>.</p>

        <p>Our work is a merger of two branches of literature.
        Namely, the study of incentive-compatible (IC) selection
        mechanisms and the study of diffusion models in networks.
        In this paper we offer, for the first time, IC mechanisms
        which try to maximize the overall diffusion.</p>
        <section id="sec-6">
          <p><em>1.1.1 Incentive-compatible mechanisms.</em>
          Incentive compatibility has been studied in many
          different contexts. The most relevant to ours are the
          following. Alon et al. ([<a class="bib" data-trigger=
          "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]) and Fischer and Klimm
          ([<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
          "popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]) studied incentive compatible
          mechanisms in networks. The goal there is to select a
          vertex with a good approximation to the maximal
          in-degree. The in-degree can be viewed as a ”one-step
          diffusion”. In our work, on the other hand, we focus on a
          more complex diffusion process. Holzman and Moulin
          ([<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
          "popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]) introduced an axiomatic
          approach to the problem of selecting a prize winning
          paper based on peer-reviews. In their model, each agent
          reports one other nominee for a prize and the mechanism
          selects one winner based on these votes. They presented a
          set of desirable features a selection mechanism should
          posses, and asked which subsets of these features we may/
          may not have together with incentive-compatibility. Their
          paper focuses on self-selection of a winner, which again
          can be viewed as ”one-step diffusion”.</p>
          <p>More recent works with the same theme can be found in
          Kurokawa et al. ([<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

          <p><em>1.1.2 Diffusion in networks.</em> The diffusion of
          information in networks (and more specifically, social
          networks) has been extensively studied ever since the
          seminal paper of Kempe, Kleinberg and Tardos ([<a class=
          "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
          data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>]). This
          literature focuses on maximization of diffusion in a
          <em>given</em> network. In our work we assume that the
          designer is unaware of the network structure, and asks
          this information from the users. In [<a class="bib"
          data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
          data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>], the
          authors have presented two diffusion models — linear
          threshold and independent cascade, and offered an
          algorithm to select a <em>k</em>-subset of the vertices.
          Their purpose was to show an algorithmically-efficient
          (i.e., polynomial) mechanism with a finite approximation
          ratio, but not necessarily IC.</p>
          <p>Our influence model relates the influence of vertex
          <em>x</em> over vertex <em>y</em> to the probability of
          reaching <em>x</em> in a random walk starting at
          <em>y</em>. Using random walks to measure
          popularity/influence is not new either: Gualdi, Medo and
          Zhang ([<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
          "popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]) used the same influence model
          to rank the influence of academic papers (in their model
          the graph is acyclic); the popular search engine, Google,
          uses random walks in its ranking algorithm, called
          PageRank ([<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
          data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]); and Andersen et al. ([<a class=
          "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
          data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]) used
          random walk in their suggestion of a trust-based
          recommendation system.</p>

          dynamics can be found in the monograph of Easley and

        </div>As we explain below, this diffusion model neatly
        relates the influence of a user to the probability of
        reaching it in a random walk, and is closely related to
        other well studied models of diffusion.
        <p></p>
        <p>The rational behind our notion of diffusion is as
        follows.</p>
        <p>If <em>y</em> follows only <em>x</em>, then he is a
        groupie fan of <em>x</em> and there is a high probability
        that he will be affected by any trend introduced by
        <em>x</em>. If on the other hand, <em>y</em> follows
        <em>x</em> and some other 99 users, then <em>x</em>’s
        influence over <em>y</em> is much lower. Moreover, if
        <em>x</em> influences <em>y</em> and <em>y</em> in turn
        influences <em>z</em>, then <em>x</em> has some indirect
        influence over <em>z</em>. Concretely, we assume that each
        user divides its attention uniformly between those he
        follows. A message from user <em>x</em> diffuses along each
        path <em>backwards</em> with probability equal to the
        multiplication of the ‘attention’ on the edges.</p>
        <p>To gain some intuition about the notion of diffusion, we
        demonstrate an example of a network and calculate the
        influence of each vertex.</p>
        <div class="example" id="enc1">
          <label>Example 2.1.</label>

          <p>The edges weights in blue denote the ‘attention
          fraction’ of this link. For example, node <em>E</em>
          follows <em>D</em> and <em>B</em>, thus each link has a
          weight of 1/2. Suppose that node <em>A</em> posts a tweet
          with a recommendation for a new product. Our model
          assumes that with probability 1/3 node <em>C</em> will be
          affected. If <em>C</em> is affected, then with
          probability 1 <em>D</em> is affected. If <em>D</em> is
          affected, then with probability 1/2 <em>E</em> is
          affected. Node <em>F</em> will either be affected

      a vertex with no out-edges or when we return to a previously
      visited vertex. The idea of the Two Path mechanism is to
      start two independent random paths from two randomly chosen
      vertices. If they intersect on an ‘unmarked’ vertex, it is
      selected; if they intersect on a ‘marked’ vertex, the
      mechanism returns ‘null’; if they do not intersect, all the
      vertices in these paths are marked, and the mechanism
      repeats. After presenting the algorithm we will prove it is

        <p>Notice that a vertex can be selected only in the first
        stage in which it is queried for its out-edges (afterwards
        it will either be selected or marked). It is enough, then,
        to show that in the first time a vertex is reached by one
        of the random paths, reporting its true edges is a best
        action. Suppose <em>P</em> <sub>1</sub> reaches vertex
        <em>v</em> and we query for its out-edges for the first
        time. Vertex <em>v</em> can only be selected if <em>P</em>
        <sub>2</sub> reaches it before it reaches any other vertex
        of <em>P</em> <sub>1</sub>. Since <em>G</em> has no cycles,
        a true report by <em>v</em> will lead to vertices which can
        be reached by <em>P</em> <sub>2</sub> only after <em>P</em>
        <sub>2</sub> has ‘missed’ <em>v</em>. Hence reporting its
        true edges cannot hurt its chances of being selected.
        Surely, reporting additional edges cannot help it. If
        <em>P</em> <sub>2</sub> reaches an unmarked vertex

        the path. Thus, the expected result in this case is

        worse scenario when <em>G</em> is a tree. Hence, we find
        that the exact approximation ratio on trees is 1.5. This

          <h2><span class="section-number">4</span> Mechanism for
          monotone DAGs</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>We remind that we define a monotone graph to be a graph in
      which any user is more influential than his followers.
      Clearly, a monotone graph must be acyclic. Monotonicity is a
      natural property in domains where the statement ”my friend is
      more influential than I am” is true for any vertex.</p>
      <p>Let <em>G</em> be a DAG. Denote by
      <em>S</em>⊆<em>V</em>(<em>G</em>) the set of <em>sinks</em>
      of <em>G</em>, i.e. the set of vertices with no out-edges.
      Denote <em>s</em> = |<em>S</em>|. In a forest, <em>S</em> is
      the set of roots and, as we proved in Theorem&nbsp;<a class=
      "enc" href="#enc8">3.4</a>, <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$ \mathbb {E}[\mathcal
      {M}_{2p}(G)]\ge cn/s$</span></span> for a constant <em>c</em>
      &gt; 0. The next example shows that this claim is not true
      for all monotone DAGs. We will show later in this section a
      mechanism which is somewhat related to <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$ \mathcal
      {M}_{2p}$</span></span> , and which generalizes
      Theorem&nbsp;<a class="enc" href="#enc8">3.4</a> for monotone
      DAGs.</p>
      <p></p>
      <div class="example" id="enc12">
        <label>Example 4.1.</label>
        <p>Consider a matrix of <em>n</em> <sup>3/4</sup> ×
        <em>n</em> <sup>1/4</sup> vertices and another vertex,
        <em>v</em> <sub>0</sub>. Suppose each vertex in row 1 ≤
        <em>i</em> ≤ <em>n</em> <sup>3/4</sup> − 1 has an edge to
        every vertex in row <em>i</em> + 1, and the vertices of row
        <em>n</em> <sup>3/4</sup> all have a single edge to vertex
        <em>v</em> <sub>0</sub>.</p>
        <p><img src=
        "../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186043/images/www2018-52-img5.svg"
        class="img-responsive" alt="" longdesc="" /></p>
        <p>The vertices of row <em>i</em> all have influence
        <em>i</em>, and vertex <em>v</em> <sub>0</sub> has
        influence <em>n</em> + 1. Thus, this graph is monotone.
        Since <em>v</em> <sub>0</sub> is the only sink,
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$
        \overline{I}=(n+1)/s=n+1=I^*$</span></span> . However,
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$ \Pr
        (\mathcal {M}_{2p}(v_0))\xrightarrow []{n\rightarrow \infty
        } 0$</span></span> . Indeed, with high probability, both
        <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> will be somewhere in the first
        <em>n</em> <sup>3/4</sup> − <em>n</em> <sup>1/2</sup> rows
        of the matrix. Since, for each of the top <em>n</em>
        <sup>1/2</sup> rows the random paths <em>P</em>
        <sub>1</sub>, <em>P</em> <sub>2</sub> have an independent
        probability of <em>n</em> <sup>− 1/4</sup> to intersect, we
        get that with high probability the two paths will intersect
        before reaching <em>v</em> <sub>0</sub>. We therefore get
        that for this monotone DAG, the Two Path mechanism does not
        have a bounded approximation ratio.</p>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <p>The mechanism which we are about to suggest for monotone
      DAGs, will not be described as an algorithmic procedure, but
      rather as an explicit distribution formula. We obtain this
      formula by first finding an explicit expression for the
      distribution of <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$ \mathcal {M}_{2p}$</span></span> , and then
      generalizing it in a natural way to monotone DAGs. We start
      by finding the distribution of <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$ \mathcal
      {M}_{2p}$</span></span> when <em>G</em> is a tree. In this
      case, the probability of two independent random paths to
      intersect in <em>v</em> ∈ <em>V</em>(<em>G</em>) is precisely
      (<em>I</em>(<em>v</em>)/<em>n</em>)<sup>2</sup>. However,
      this is not the probability <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$ \Pr (\mathcal
      {M}_{2p}=v)$</span></span> , because <em>v</em> is only
      selected if it is the <em>first</em> intersection of the two
      paths. Define the recursive function:</p>
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq3">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\begin{align}
          Z(v)=Z(v,G):=\left(\dfrac{I(v)}{n}\right)^2-\sum _{u\in
          P(v)}Z(u), \end{align}</span><br />
          <span class="equation-number">(3)</span>
        </div>
      </div>where <em>P</em>(<em>v</em>)⊆<em>V</em> is the progeny
      set of <em>v</em>, i.e. all vertices which have a path to
      <em>v</em> (not including <em>v</em> itself). We can then
      write
      <div class="table-responsive">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\[ \Pr (\mathcal
          {M}_{2p}=v)=Z(v), \]</span><br />
        </div>
      </div>and we have found an explicit expression for the
      distribution induced by <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$ \mathcal
      {M}_{2p}$</span></span> . We remark that it is not hard to
      prove, using simple induction, that
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq4">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\begin{align}

          \end{align}</span><br />
          <span class="equation-number">(4)</span>
        </div>
      </div>Now suppose that <em>G</em> is a forest. Observe the
      following:
      <p></p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list13" label="•">The probability that <em>v</em> ∈

        <li id="list14" label="•">In every subsequent stage,
        <em>v</em> will have probability <em>Z</em>(<em>v</em>) to
        be selected, provided the two paths did not intersect in
        previous stages and <em>v</em> was not marked.<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let <em>Z</em> = <em>Z</em>(<em>G</em>) ≔ ∑
      <sub><em>u</em> ∈ <em>V</em></sub> <em>Z</em>(<em>u</em>) = ∑
      <sub><em>r</em> ∈
      <em>S</em>(<em>G</em>)</sub>(<em>I</em>(<em>r</em>)/<em>n</em>)<sup>2</sup>
      denote the probability that in a single stage the two paths
      intersect. Let <em>G<sub>v</sub></em> be the graph we get
      from <em>G</em> after removing all the out-edges of
      <em>v</em>. Then <em>Z<sub>v</sub></em> =
      <em>Z</em>(<em>G<sub>v</sub></em> ) is the probability that
      in a single stage the Two Path intersected but none of them
      went through <em>v</em>, unless <em>v</em> is the
      intersection vertex (this is because <em>v</em> is a root
      vertex in <em>G<sub>v</sub></em> ). Thus, if we denote by
      <em>q</em>(<em>v</em>) the probability that in a single stage
      the two paths did not intersect and none of them went through
      <em>v</em>, then</p>
      <div class="table-responsive">
        <div class="display-equation">

        </div>
      </div>We conclude that

          <span class="equation-number">(5)</span>

      </div>We will now use this last expression as a baseline for

      <p></p>
      <p>Let <em>G</em> be a DAG. In a forest the influence of one
      vertex over the other, <em>I</em>(<em>v</em>, <em>u</em>), is
      either 1 or 0. This is no longer the case for DAGs. To
      account for this difference we alter the function we defined

      does not even have a bounded approximation ratio in the
      family of trees. Take, for example, the complete binary tree.
      After the random ordering and edges-removal, we will get a

      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$ \mathcal

      <em>n</em>/log <em>n</em>. Nevertheless, in the next section

      <p>It has been long known that many real-world networks, and

      their degree distribution follows a power law<a class="fn"
      href="#fn10" id="foot-fn10"><sup>9</sup></a> (see, for

            DAGs</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The first and perhaps most famous model for the
        emergence of scale-free graphs, is that of Barabási and
        Albert. In their model the network starts with an initial
        set of <em>s</em> vertices and no edges. At each step we
        add a new vertex to the graph and connect it to <em>k</em>
        existing vertices, which are randomly selected according to
        distribution which is linearly proportionate to the current
        degree of the vertices. Thus a vertex with already high
        degree is more likely to get more new links (a sort of
        ‘rich get richer’ phenomenon). This model was originally
        defined to generate undirected graphs. By directing the
        edges from the new vertex to the old ones, we get a
        directed model which is also acyclic. Moreover, the initial
        set of <em>s</em> vertices are precisely the sinks of the
        generated DAG. We used this model to simulate academic
        papers’ citation networks, and tested the working of the
        Two Path mechanism on these networks. We have fixed the
        number of vertices at 10,000 and simulated networks while
        changing two parameters: the number of sinks (i.e., size of
        the initial set), and the out-degree of each new vertex. We
        observed that as we increase the number of sinks, the
        approximation ratio of our mechanism worsens. On the other
        hand, increasing the degree improves the outcome. Notice
        that this is in accordance to the reasoning of
        Theorem&nbsp;<a class="enc" href="#enc8">3.4</a>, since a
        denser DAG with less sinks is more likely to be balanced.
        Two representative samples of this phenomenon can be seen
        in Figures&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> and
        <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>. In both, each dot
        represents an average of 100 random networks. For each
        network we ran the mechanism 100 times and averaged the
        outcome. Thus, each dot represents 10,000 runs of the
        mechanism with the appropriate network parameters.
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> shows the
        deterioration of the ratio when we increase the number of
        sinks while holding the degree fixed. Figure&nbsp;<a class=
        "fig" href="#fig2">2</a> shows the improvement of the ratio
        when we increase the degree while holding the number of
        sinks fixed. We also noticed that typically, the
        approximation ratio was in the range of 3-10. This implies
        that in real-world networks, the Two Path mechanism can be
        expected to perform much better than the mathematical
        bounds we were able to prove.</p>

        <p>In order to simulate Twitter-like networks, we used the
        model suggested in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. In that paper the authors show
        that their model is more suited to simulate the dynamic
        nature of social networks than the Barabási-Albert model.
        In particular, they show that their model generates graphs
        which resemble Twitter in a few interesting parameters. In
        their model, at each step one of the following happens.</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list15" label="•">With probability <em>p</em> a
          new vertex is added with an out-going edge to an existing
          vertex. The target vertex is chosen according to a
          distribution linearly proportionate to the current
          in-degree of the vertices.<br /></li>
          <li id="list16" label="•">With probability <em>q</em> a
          new vertex is added with an in-going edge from an
          existing vertex. The source vertex is chosen according to
          a distribution linearly proportionate to the current
          out-degree of the vertices.<br /></li>
          <li id="list17" label="•">With probability <em>r</em> a
          new edge is added between two existing vertices. The
          source vertex is chosen according to a distribution
          linearly proportionate to the current out-degree of the
          vertices and the target vertex is chosen according to a
          distribution linearly proportionate to the current
          in-degree of the vertices.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, we need to require that <em>p</em> +
        <em>q</em> + <em>r</em> = 1. In addition, it is assumed
        that <em>q</em> &lt; <em>p</em>. We used this model with
        different parameters to test mechanism <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$ \mathcal
        {M}_{2p}^G$</span></span> . Again, we fixed the number of
        vertices at 10,000 and were interested in the influence of
        two parameters on the performance of our mechanism. The
        first parameter is the average in-degree in the graph; in
        the parameters of the model, this is equal to 1/(<em>p</em>
        + <em>q</em>)<a class="fn" href="#fn11" id=
        "foot-fn11"><sup>10</sup></a>. The second is the
        probability of a ‘reverse edge’, <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\hat{q}=q/(p+q)$</span></span> , which is the
        probability of a new vertex to get an edge. We think of
        this parameter as some indication of how far the graph will
        be from a DAG (although cycles can also be created on steps
        where an edge is created between two existing vertices). We
        observed as before that an increase in the average degree
        (meaning, an increase in the density of the graph) improves
        the performance of the mechanism. On the other hand, an
        increase in <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$ \hat{q}$</span></span> worsens the average outcome.
        The reason for that might be that some vertices reach high
        influence due to a few ‘lucky’ edges from other
        high-influence vertices, while mechanism <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$ \mathcal
        {M}_{2p}^G$</span></span> performs better when there is
        higher correlation between high influence and high
        in-degree. Again we show two samples of our tests.
        Figures&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> and
        <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> both present the running
        of the mechanism on simulated networks with 10,000
        vertices. Each dot represents 100 networks which are tested
        100 times each, so a dot is an average of 10,000 outcomes.
        In the first figure we show the tests in which we held
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$
        \hat{q}$</span></span> fixed while increasing the average
        degree, and in the second figure we show the tests in which
        we did the opposite. We see that mechanism <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$ \mathcal
        {M}_{2p}^G$</span></span> gives a nicely bounded
        approximation ratio in most scenarios and we thus expect it
        to perform well in real-life social networks.</p>

    <p id="fn4"><a href="#foot-fn4"><sup>3</sup></a>We take
    <em>I</em>(∅) = 0 in the calculation of the expectation.</p>
    <p id="fn5"><a href="#foot-fn5"><sup>4</sup></a>Note that we do

    <p id="fn6"><a href="#foot-fn6"><sup>5</sup></a>Observe that a

    acyclic.</p>

    to the path P<sub>1</sub>.</p>
    <p id="fn8"><a href="#foot-fn8"><sup>7</sup></a>At the first
    round the probability that <em>x</em> will be selected is
    <em>O</em>(<em>n</em> <sup>− 1</sup>), whereas the probability
    that <em>x</em> will be marked is <em>O</em>(<em>n</em> <sup>−
    1/2</sup>). Same is true for all the first <em>n</em>
    <sup>3/4</sup> rounds. Therefore, the probability that
    <em>x</em> will be selected during at the first <em>n</em>
    <sup>3/4</sup> rounds is <em>o</em>(<em>n</em> <sup>−
    1/4</sup>), while the probability that it will be marked is
    close to 1.</p>
    <p id="fn9"><a href="#foot-fn9"><sup>8</sup></a>If the sum is
    strictly less than 1, then the rest of the probability goes to
    ∅.</p>
    <p id="fn10"><a href="#foot-fn10"><sup>9</sup></a>Notice, that
    in this case, reporting the true edges becomes a weakly
    dominant strategy for all vertices.</p>
    <p id="fn11"><a href="#foot-fn11"><sup>10</sup></a>Meaning that
    the fraction of vertices which have in-degree <em>k</em> is
    proportional to <em>k</em> <sup>− <em>λ</em></sup> where
    <em>λ</em> &gt; 1 is a parameter of the network.</p>
    <p id="fn12"><a href="#foot-fn12"><sup>11</sup></a>At each step
    a new edge is created. The probability of a new vertex in every
    step is <em>p</em> + <em>q</em>, hence the expected average
    degree will be 1/(<em>p</em> + <em>q</em>).</p>
