          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Wikipedia is the online encyclopedia that anyone can edit.
      Many editors contribute every day to expand Wikipedia content
      and keep it updated. Also, many users read Wikipedia every
      day&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>].
      Reading and navigating Wikipedia is facilitated by a
      hyperlink network that connects related articles.</p>
      <p>However, many hyperlinks are currently missing. When
      readers do not find the link to a page <em>v</em> from their
      current page <em>u</em>, they use the search box (on the top
      right corner of page <em>u</em>) to navigate from page
      <em>u</em> to page <em>v</em>. Some of these searches can be
      casual or because of an ongoing trend in news or social
      media. For instance in Wikipedia, during February 2016, the
      time when Donald Trump was nominated as Republican Nominee,
      users navigated from his Wikipedia page to different other
      Wikipedia pages like <em>Trump University</em>, <em>Hollywood
      Walk of Fame</em>, <em>Hillary Clinton</em>, etc. Though the
      number of searches between those pages was in thousands, they
      were casual as they didn't continue after that period.</p>
      <p>Other searches, instead, suggest the demand of a physical
      link from page <em>u</em> to page <em>v</em> to improve
      users’ navigation. For instance, in Wikipedia, there were
      many searches between two pages <em>Doctor Strange
      (film)</em> and <em>Baron Mordo</em> in February 2016 and
      users continued to navigate between these two pages even
      until April 2016. Later on, a hyperlink from <em>Doctor
      Strange (film)</em> to <em>Baron Mordo</em> was created after
      April 2016.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we describe our on-going research on the
      problem of predicting needed hyperlinks between pairs of
      non-connected pages (<em>u</em>, <em>v</em>) that show
      readers’ search propagation from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>.
      Our proposed solution leverages the information on the
      estimated duration of these searches and predicts new
      hyperlinks according to descending order of duration. In
      fact, the longer readers keep searching from <em>u</em> to
      <em>v</em>, the higher the probability that a hyperlink from
      <em>u</em> to <em>v</em> is needed to improve readers’
      navigation. Our initial experimental results show that our
      best solution achieves an AUROC of 0.77 on the Wikipedia
      Clickstream dataset and a precision@20% of 1.0 and
      significantly beats the baselines with 9% of AUROC
      improvement.</p>

      <p>Wikipedia Clickstream is a Wikimedia's research
      project&nbsp;<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> in progress. The
      dataset&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>] consists of pairs (referrer page,
      resource page) obtained from the extracted request logs of
      Wikipedia. There are eight (non-contiguous) months’ datasets
      released till December 2017, starting from January 2015. Each
      dataset contains a set of tuples of the from <em>(prev, curr,
      type, n)</em> where:</p>
      <p><strong>prev</strong> is the referrer URL or Wikipedia
      page title if the referrer is within Wikipedia.</p>
      <p><strong>curr</strong> is the title of the webpage the
      client requested or Wikipedia page title if the resource page
      is within Wikipedia.</p>
      <p><strong>type</strong> describes <em>(prev, curr)</em> as
      (a) <em>link</em> if the referrer and request are both
      Wikipedia pages and the referrer links to the request, (b)
      <em>external</em> if the referrer host is not
      en.wikipedia.org, and (c) <em>other</em> if the referrer and
      request are both Wikipedia pages but the referrer does not
      link to the request. This can happen when clients search or
      spoof their referrer.</p>
      <p><strong>n</strong> is the number of occurrences (greater
      than 10) of the (referrer, resource) pair. Considered as
      number of hits from <em>prev</em> to <em>curr</em>.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we focus on pairs of pages having
      <em>type=’other’</em>. They refer to pairs of pages from
      Wikipedia which do not have a direct link between them, but
      users navigated through search bar of the Wikipedia
      pages.</p>
      <p>For our initial set of experiments, we consider February
      2016 (27M of tuples), March 2016 (25M of tuples), and April
      2016 (21M of tuples) datasets as they are the longest
      consecutive months available in Clickstream. For new links
      ground truth we considered August 2016 dataset (24M of
      tuples, out of which 14M have <em>type=’link’</em>). Also, we
      filtered out from February 2016 <em>other</em> types of
      tuples having <em>prev</em> or <em>curr</em> equal to the
      Wikipedia Main Page. This is because the Main page changes
      every day and searches from or to this page represent noise
      in the dataset.</p>

      <p>There is plenty of work on the hyperlink prediction
      problem in Wikipedia. Adafre et al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] proposed an approach to
      find missing hyperlinks in the network by considering a
      Wikipedia corpus and its underlying abstract words. They
      stated that similar pages should have similar hyperlinks.
      Noraset et al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] did a similar work by considering the
      text in Wikipedia pages. West et al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] proposed a method based on
      principal component analysis of the hyperlink adjacency
      matrix. In another work, West et al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] used human navigation logs
      available from The Wiki Game<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id=
      "foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Wikispeedia&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] to identify
      missing links in Wikipedia. Recently, Paranjape et
      al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]
      addressed the problem of suggesting hyperlinks to add in the
      encyclopedia that improve readers’ navigation and maintain a
      high-quality link structure. In some sense, they are close to
      our work because they are suggesting links that are useful in
      the future. However, their framework is more general than
      ours. Also, there is a main difference between our work and
      the one of Paranjape et al. when we have to predict the link
      between two pages (<em>prev</em>, <em>curr</em>) having
      <em>type</em> = “<em>other</em>”. More specifically, their
      method relies on the number of hits from <em>prev</em> to
      <em>curr</em> only, while we consider the estimated duration,
      computed by using many other network-based variables, of how
      long readers will keep searching from <em>prev</em> to
      <em>curr</em>. Moreover, the distribution of hits for pairs
      of pages having <em>type</em> = “<em>other</em>” in February
      2016 dataset is the same for pairs of pages that will have or
      not a hyperlink, suggesting that the number of hits alone is
      not a good predictor for our problem.</p>

          Prediction Framework</h2>

      </header>
      <p>In this paper, we address the problem of predicting
      hyperlinks between pairs of pages (<em>u</em>, <em>v</em>) of
      type “<em>other</em>” in the Clickstream dataset. If readers
      persistently keep searching for page <em>v</em> from page
      <em>u</em>, then this is the signal that a hyperlink may be
      needed from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em> to improve their
      navigation.</p>
      <p>We propose a <em>novel</em> approach to solve the problem
      in two steps. First, we focus on the problem of predicting
      how long will readers keep searching from page <em>u</em> to
      page <em>v</em>. Second, once the duration is estimated, we
      predict new hyperlinks according to their descending
      order.</p>
      <p>We performed a two-sample one-tail t-test to test our
      hypothesis that the longer readers keep searching from page
      <em>u</em> to page <em>v</em>, the higher is the probability
      that a hyperlink will be added from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>.
      The <em>p</em>-value for a significant level <em>α</em> =
      0.01 resulted less than 0.001 on the Clickstream dataset
      considered, suggesting that there is strong statistical
      evidence to validate our hypothesis. More specifically,
      readers keep searching for 2.02 months for pairs of pages
      that end up to be linked vs. 1.56 months for pages that will
      not be linked.</p>
      <p>We propose two supervised learning approaches for the
      problem of predicting the duration of the searches. Given a
      set of features, the <em>basic</em> approach consists of
      learning a binary classifier to predict whether or not the
      searches will last in the future. The second and more
      <em>fine-grained</em> approach consists of estimating how
      long the searches will last by modeling the problem via
      survival analysis&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] or as a regression task.</p>
      <p>We used the following set of features in our preliminary
      evaluation: node degree, number of hits from page <em>u</em>
      to page <em>v</em>, common neighbors, Jaccard similarity,
      Adamic-Adar similarity, preferential attachment score, local
      clustering coefficient, Pagerank of both pages <em>u</em> and
      <em>v</em>, and the Hadamard (or entrywise) product of
      Node2Vec feature vectors <em>F</em>(<em>u</em>) and
      <em>F</em>(<em>v</em>)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=

          Results</h2>

      </header>
      <p>We divided the data into three time periods: we consider
      candidate pairs of pages for link prediction those appearing
      as type “<em>other</em>” in February 2016; we trained the
      model to estimate the searches duration in March and April
      2016, and tested hyperlink prediction in August 2016. We used
      majority under-sampling to deal with class imbalance.</p>
      <p>Our results show that we achieve an AUROC of 0.78 (with
      random forest) on the problem of predicting whether or not
      the searches from page <em>u</em> to page <em>v</em> will
      last (basic approach), while regression performs better than
      survival analysis (fine-grained approach) on the problem of
      predicting the duration of these searches (Mean Absol. Error
      of 0.094 vs. 0.118 and Pearson Corr. Coeff. of 0.91 vs.
      0.32).</p>
      <p>Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> (top rows)
      shows how our proposed framework performs on hyperlink
      prediction. In this experiment, we first trained the model
      (classification, survival analysis, or regression) to predict
      how long (or “if” in the case of classification) the searches
      will last. Then we computed the AUROC between these predicted
      times and the class values (1 if the hyperlink has been
      created later on, 0 otherwise). As we can see, using the
      information on whether or not the searches will last is not
      sufficient to predict new hyperlinks (AUROC of 0.5 with SVM
      with RBF kernel). Instead, if we are using a more
      fine-grained approach with Lasso regression that is
      predicting how long the interaction will last, we can achieve
      an AUROC of 0.769.</p>
      <p>To compare our results, we considered hits, Jaccard
      Similarity, Adamic-Adar, preferential attachment, and cosine
      similarity between Node2Vec feature vectors
      <em>F</em>(<em>u</em>) and <em>F</em>(<em>v</em>),
      individually as baselines and assumed their value to be an
      approximation of the duration of the searches from page
      <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>. As we can see in
      Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> (bottom rows)
      our approach outperforms Node2Vec, the best performing
      baseline, that achieves an AUROC of 0.583. Also, our result
      is better than a classical link prediction approach that
      considers all the features in input to a classifier, do not
      consider search duration, and can predict new hyperlinks with
      an AUROC of 0.679.</p>
      <p>We also computed the precision@<em>k</em> curves for our
      best approach, the best baseline (Node2Vec), and the
      classical approach. These curves are shown in
      Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>. We see that
      our approach generally achieves a better precision. In
      particular, we have the highest precision on top-ranked pairs
      of pages (precision of 1.0 for both <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$k=10\%$</span></span>
      and <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$k=20\%$</span></span> , and of 0.97 for <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$k=30\%$</span></span> ).
      The drop at <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$k=50\%$</span></span> means that no hyperlinks are
      found for <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$30\% {\lt} k \le 50\%$</span></span> , which suggests
      further research is needed to improve.</p>

      <p>As future work, we plan to extend the set of features
      considered including both page content and categories’
      similarities to improve our current results. In fact, we
      observed that, by adding category-based similarity features,
      we can improve the performances of the basic approach.
      Indeed, we can achieve an AUROC of 0.83 for the problem of
      predicting whether or not the searches from page <em>u</em>
      to page <em>v</em> will last, vs. the current value of 0.78
      obtained by considering network-based features only.</p>
      <p>Also, the Wikimedia Foundation recently announced that
      they started releasing Clickstream datasets on a monthly
      basis. Currently, November and December 2017 have been
      released. Thus, we plan to test our approach on a larger
      scale once a higher number of consecutive months are
      released.</p>
