        <p><small>This paper aims to shed light on alternative news
        media ecosystems that are believed to have influenced
        opinions and beliefs by false and/or biased news reporting
        during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. We examine a
        large, professionally curated list of 668 hyper-partisan
        websites and their corresponding Facebook pages, and
        identify key characteristics that mediate the traffic flow
        within this ecosystem. We uncover a pattern of new websites
        being established in the run up to the elections, and
        abandoned after. Such websites form an ecosystem, creating
        links from one website to another, and by ‘liking’ each
        others’ Facebook pages. These practices are highly
        effective in directing user traffic internally within the
        ecosystem in a highly partisan manner, with right-leaning
        sites linking to and liking other right-leaning sites and
        similarly left-leaning sites linking to other sites on the
        left, thus forming a filter bubble amongst news
        <em>producers</em> similar to the filter bubble which has
        been widely observed among <em>consumers</em> of partisan
        news. Whereas there is activity along both left- and
        right-leaning sites, right-leaning sites are more evolved,
        accounting for a disproportionate number of abandoned
        websites and partisan internal links. We also examine
        demographic characteristics of consumers of hyper-partisan
        news and find that some of the more populous demographic
        groups in the US tend to be consumers of more right-leaning
        sites.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The rise of the Internet and social media platforms has
      given a new dimension to the democratic process. From a
      political science perspective, the idea of open participation
      platforms like blogs and social media websites have been
      shown to have high impact in the democratic
      process&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] and may well be instrumental in
      shaping the elections of the future, as demonstrated by the
      2016 US elections. As such, it is crucial for political and
      social scientists to assess the modalities and attitudes
      towards partisan media, and to understand their
      modus-operandi.</p>
      <p>So far, research has focused on evaluating the role of
      <em>social</em> media and platforms like <tt>Reddit</tt> and
      <tt>4chan</tt> in the process of sharing mainstream and
      alternative news on the web and the lexical value of the
      language used by fake-news content&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>]. This research has
      revealed a deep divide between views of the so-called ‘right’
      or ‘conservatives’, and the ‘left’ or ‘liberals’.</p>
      <p>This paper attempts to shed first light on hyper-partisan
      <em>news</em> websites that have arisen in parallel to this
      divided social media discourse. ‘Hyper-partisan’ is a moniker
      that is believed to originate from a recent article in the
      New York Times Magazine&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] and refers to reporting that departs
      from traditional notions of journalistic balance, and
      presents a biased picture of one side of a political debate.
      In the context of the 2016 US Elections, overt support of the
      Democratic (respectively Republican) party or their
      candidate(s) is taken to represent a liberal or left-leaning
      (resp. a conservative, or right-leaning) bias. We are
      interested in understanding the producers of hyper-partisan
      news, the consumers who visit them, and the dynamics of how
      Web traffic is directed towards such sites.</p>
      <p>We base our study on an ecosystem of 668
      hyper-partisan<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> websites and associated Facebook
      pages shared with us by Buzzfeed News as part of a recent
      collaborative investigation connected with the 2016 US
      Elections. Building on this dataset<a class="fn" href="#fn2"
      id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>, we collect data from
      <tt>Alexa.com</tt> about the size of the traffic to these
      sites, from Facebook about the structure of connections
      (likes, etc.) between the different Facebook pages, and from
      URL shorteners like <tt>bit.ly</tt> about the clickthrough
      rates for short URLs associated with news stories. Our
      central approach is to make use of the reliable and impartial
      manual coding of websites into ‘left’ and ‘right’ by our
      Buzzfeed collaborators, and use our augmented data to shed
      light on partisan behaviour on both sides of the political
      spectrum.</p>
      <p>Our first main finding is that there is a large amount of
      linking between partisan sites that refer traffic between
      each other. These referrals mostly stick to one side of the
      political debate – right-leaning websites refer traffic to
      other right-leaning sites; left-leaning sites link to
      left-leaning ones. In other words, among these
      <em>producers</em> of hyper-partisan news, we find echo
      chambers similar to those which have been widely discussed
      (e.g., in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]) among <em>consumers</em> on social
      media. Unsurprisingly, we find a similar right-left
      cliquishness when we study the corresponding Facebook pages
      of these news sites, and ask which Page is ‘liked’ by which
      other page. Completing the picture, the audiences of the
      Facebook pages are similarly divided across right-left lines,
      which is closer to the traditional notion of echo chambers in
      social media.</p>
      <p>Next, examining domain ownership records, we find evidence
      of a significant boom and decline of hyper-partisan news
      corresponding with the 2016 US Election cycle – a remarkable
      number (nearly one third) of new sites, especially
      right-leaning ones, were registered in 2016, during the
      run-up to the elections. Several are from Macedonia,
      providing independent confirmation of the role of Macedonian
      teenagers in propagating false and biased
      information&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>]. Similarly, a disproportionate
      number of these sites also “die out” and lose popularity in
      Alexa Traffic Rankings in the period between the Nov 2016
      elections and President Trump's inauguration.</p>
      <p>This establishment and abandonment of website domains is
      stronger amongst right-leaning sites, suggesting that the
      American Right or Conservative populace was more strongly
      influenced by hyper-partisan sites during the election.
      Complementary to this, we examine the demographics of the
      audience of hyper-partisan sites and find that Americans who
      visit these hyper- partisan sites are more right-leaning:
      Sampled mean demographic audience sizes for some of the most
      populous demographic groups of USA (e.g., white caucasians,
      or middle income ranges) are higher for right-leaning
      sites.</p>
      <p>Collectively, these results shed first light on an
      ecosystem of websites that affected the 2016 US Elections by
      presenting a partisan viewpoint. The rest of this paper is
      structured as follows. §<a class="sec" href="#sec-6">2</a>
      places our paper in the context of related work. §<a class=
      "sec" href="#sec-7">3</a> describes the dataset provided to
      us by Buzzfeed and our additional data collection efforts
      with Alexa, bit.ly, and Facebook. §<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-16">4</a> examines the websites studying the
      characteristics of its owners and the evolution of traffic to
      these sites. §<a class="sec" href="#sec-17">5</a> presents a
      complementary picture, studying the demographics of the
      <em>audience</em> of these sites. §<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-18">6</a> examines the producer side filter-bubble
      caused by the partisan referral of traffic from one website
      to another of the same political leaning. §<a class="sec"
      href="#sec-22">7</a> studies demographics and traffic flows
      from the perspective of Facebook pages associated with these
      sites, finding similar evidence of internal referrals and
      increased activity on the right. §<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-26">8</a> concludes.</p>

      <p>We contextualize our work by providing a brief discussion
      of three key themes of research in this area. We survey the
      previous works which looked at <em>Role of News sources</em>,
      <em>Role of echo chambers and filter bubbles</em> and
      <em>Role of social media in dissemination of fake news</em>.
      To this extent our work augments and extends previous
      literature by presenting a data-driven analysis of the
      producers and consumers of partisan websites, and the traffic
      forwarding behaviour that underpins their sustainability and
      supports on-line echo chambers.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Role of news sources</em></strong>.
      Classically political and social science heavily relies on
      survey-based inferences. There have been important studies on
      partisan news media in the US over the past few years. These
      methods help the community get important insights into the
      divides in audience attitudes towards media [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>] and the role of social
      media in news dissemination [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>]. However, what they lack is an
      understanding of how news websites are shaping these
      attitudes and trends, and what role social networks play in
      facilitating the spread of partisan information. A recent
      data-driven work&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] provides insights into the role of
      fake news in US elections. The authors use interesting
      sources of data, such as a crowd-driven website
      <tt>Snopes.com</tt> that refutes fake rumors and conspiracy
      theories. They further find predictors for believability on
      face news. Their study is highly selective towards the fake
      news phenomenon, and ignores the effect of online news
      sources (such as <em>Breitbart</em>, <em>Infowars</em>,
      <em>ThinkProgress</em>, <em>OccupyDemocrats</em>) that
      promote partisan content which may not necessarily be fake.
      We find in our study that these sources have big enough
      presence to shape traffic and grab click-through rates as
      high as 4% on their posts. Karamshuk <em>et
      al.</em>&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>] showed quantitative evidence for
      biased reporting in news and social media across national
      divides in the context of the recent conflict between Russia
      and Ukraine. Our work in contrast applies to ideological
      divides within a nation, and during a national election
      rather than a conflict situation.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Role of echo chambers and filter
      bubbles</em></strong>. Echo chambers refer to the phenomenon
      when people do not subscribe to views that do not agree with
      their own. Coupled with recommendation system algorithms, a
      self-reinforcing ecosystem emerges where users get fed
      information that suits their opinions&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. Pariser&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>] argues
      that the ubiquitous nature of technology that personalizes
      every search and every interaction has created this “In the
      Loop” process. This has inspired a series of works on
      recommendation systems for Facebook users that have revealed
      both the presence of filter bubbles and awareness among some
      users about their existence&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]. Recent work for probable
      remedies &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] explores breaking the polarized echo
      chambers by exposing users to opposing sides of discourse.
      Our work can help such fledgling efforts by helping shed
      light on the nature of the divide between different
      viewpoints.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Role of social media in dissemination of fake
      news</em></strong>. The issue of fake news and conspiracies
      has received considerable attention since the 2016 US
      Presidential election. Various studies&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>] have explored the role of
      social media and platforms like Reddit and 4chan in the
      process of sharing mainstream and alternative news on the
      web—but these focus on the lexical value of the language used
      by fake-news content. Starbird et. al&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>] explore the alternative
      media domain networks by analyzing 58M total tweets related
      to mass shooting events for a period of about 10 months
      beginning in January 2016, and provide a qualitative analysis
      of how alternative news sites propagate and promote false
      narratives while mainstream media refrains from such
      behaviour. They show the presence of domain clusters that
      control the flow of information with the alternative news
      ecosystem and their political polarization. As the scope of
      this work is limited to the Twitter activity of influential
      alternative news websites, it does not capture the referer
      traffic patterns between social network pages or the actual
      web pages. Our work complements the findings of this paper
      using other modalities of data and other datasets.</p>

        <p>As mentioned previously, Buzzfeed News provided us with
        a dataset which was collected and curated by them in the
        context of an investigation into partisan news in the 2016
        US Presidential Elections. This dataset consists of two
        main parts: a list of 668 websites which were classified by
        them as partisan, and a list of Facebook pages which are
        associated with these websites.</p>
        <section id="sec-9">
          <p><em>3.1.1 Partisan websites dataset.</em> The Buzzfeed
          data set contains of a list of 668 unique partisan sites,
          of which 489 were classified as left-leaning and 179 as
          right-leaning after a careful manual examination by two
          journalists from Buzzfeed News. These 668 websites form
          the basis of the rest of our study, and we take as ground
          truth the journalists’ professionally informed
          categorisation of the websites into ‘left’ and ‘right’.
          In addition, the following key attributes were collected
          about each site: registration date, Facebook Id, owner
          firstname, lastname and company, political category,
          Google analytics and Google Adsense codes</p>

          <p><em>3.1.2 Facebook.</em> Facebook has become an
          important platform for communications. Many news
          organisations, including virtually all major mainstream
          newspapers maintain associated Facebook pages. The
          Facebook page for each website in our dataset was
          identified using either direct links from the website
          itself, or using the CrowdTangle browser plugin to
          identify Facebook pages which share all the content from
          the corresponding website. 507 of the 668 websites have
          public Facebook pages that could be programmatically
          accessed. For each accessible Facebook page, the dataset
          contains engagement information of each post— status id,
          status message, status link, status type, timestamp when
          the post was published, no. of reactions, no. of comments
          and no. of shares of 4M posts between January 1st, 2015
          and March 31st, 2017. Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=

          <p><em>3.1.3 On the Quality and Completeness of the
          Buzzfeed Data.</em> To our knowledge, this dataset
          represents one of the most comprehensive lists of
          partisan news websites associated with the 2016 US
          elections. Buzzfeed's article&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
          data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
          data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]
          publishes full details about the process used to curate
          this data. In summary, Buzzfeed curated the list using
          two journalists who were dedicated to identifying
          partisan news. Websites were added based on the criterion
          that “they are clear about their political views and
          alignment and/or are explicitly ideological in their
          identity”. Although it is hard to include every eligible
          website (for many reasons, e.g., new ones are constantly
          created, and others lose traffic, as discussed in
          §<a class="sec" href="#sec-16">4</a>), an effort was made
          to ensure that the dataset is reasonably complete. After
          collecting a seed set of 500 sites, the journalists
          identified other links on the home pages of these
          publications to further expand the dataset. In addition,
          the authors of this paper leveraged Alexa traffic
          referral data (<a class="sec" href="#sec-13">3.2.1</a>),
          and compiled a list of 78 potential websites that are
          among the top 5 referers of traffic to the websites in
          the dataset. This list was passed to our collaborators in
          Buzzfeed News. After a manual examination by them, only 8
          of the 78 were deemed as important (and added to the list
          of partisan Websites), which provides an indirect
          indication of the completeness of the original list.</p>
          <p>Altogether, this process identified 668 Websites which
          form our base dataset. Each website in the final list was
          classified by the Buzzfeed journalists as ‘left’ or
          ‘right’ based on self identification on the website or
          its associated page, or if an overt ideological
          preference could be deduced by manual examination. The
          rest of our analysis relies on the manual coding of sites
          into ‘left’ and ’right’ by the two professional
          journalists. While there are many more right-leaning
          sites than left-leaning ones, we believe that this is due
          to difference in hyper-partisan activity between the two
          sides of the political spectrum. Where relevant to the
          result, we take care to adjust for this imbalance in the
          dataset.</p>

        <p>We augmented the data provided by Buzzfeed News by
        collecting information from a diverse set of data sources
        that can shed light on the traffic and other engagement
        metrics of the partisan websites and their Facebook pages.
        This included using Alexa Web Analytics, gathering
        engagement counts and other metrics from Facebook,
        examining short URLs to determine click through rates.</p>
        <section id="sec-13">
          <p><em>3.2.1 Alexa.</em> Alexa is an internet portal
          which provides web analytics including website traffic
          statistics, site comparisons, and website audience.
          Alexa's measurement panel is based on a diverse set of
          over 25,000 browser extensions and plug-ins used by
          millions of people&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
          "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>]. Alexa does not reveal the full
          methodology it uses to collect data, but notes that the
          current implementation extends beyond the common
          understanding that it is based on a single popular
          browser toolbar&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
          data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>].</p>
          <p>Although Alexa's data collection methodology may lead
          to some biases, it is believed to be the best available
          option for demographic and traffic information on the
          Web&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
          data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>]. Alexa provides a basic notion
          of reliability by filtering data and only reporting
          statistics about a website when it believes that the
          website has sufficient measurable traffic
          available<a class="fn" href="#fn5" id=
          "foot-fn5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Our choice of using Alexa is
          based on these factors.</p>
          <p>To gain further insights about the traffic flow
          patterns of the partisan sites, we crawled several
          metrics from Alexa between June–July 2017 for the
          websites. The main metrics gathered were the current
          traffic rankings, the variation in traffic rank for the
          past one year (this is available as a chart; we crawled
          and converted this into actual ranks), top-5 upstream
          sites (sites which the users visit before visiting the
          site in question), and audience demographics, such as the
          distributions of age ranges, ethnicity, gender, education
          and income levels of the visitors to each site.</p>
          <p>According to Alexa, the rank data is derived from the
          traffic data provided by the users in Alexa's Global Data
          Panel over a rolling 3 month period and is based on the
          browsing pattern of people in Alexa's Global Data
          Panel<a class="fn" href="#fn6" id=

          demographics information submitted by people in our
          global traffic panel. The data is for the past 12 months,

      <p>Largely, we observe that most of the owner companies have
      overt political affiliations i.e. they either handle
      collections of conservative or liberal sites. One prominent
      exception to this is <em>Today's Growth Consultant</em> that
      runs 5 conservative sites including <em>My Right America</em>
      and <em>Red White and Right</em> along with <em>Progressive
      Liberal</em> which is a left leaning site. Such bipartisan
      ownership of partisan websites suggests that the motive
      behind running collections of partisan sites cannot solely be
      attributed to propaganda but might also include financial
      incentives (e.g., advertising revenue).</p>
      <p><strong><em>Birth and death of partisan
      websites</em></strong>. Next, we analyse the role played by
      the US election timeline on the production of partisan
      content. We map the birth of these websites by using the date
      of the domain name registrations (Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig"
      href="#fig1">1</a>). 188 of the 668 websites – nearly a third
      – were registered <em>in the election year of 2016</em>,
      making it the year with the most number of domain name
      registrations for the sites in our dataset.</p>
      <figure id="fig1">

      <p>Among these 188 websites, 81% support conservative views
      while 19% are liberal, pointing to an increased activity of
      partisan news on the conservative side. Note that this
      activity is disproportionately large considering that about
      73% of the sites in our overall dataset are conservative.</p>
      <p>Then we study the ‘death’ or loss of traffic for these
      websites. We do this by acquiring the longitudinal Alexa rank
      numbers for the websites spanning across the period of one
      year.</p>

      <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> provides the
      distribution of the time of peak Alexa rank (or equivalently,
      peak traffic) for the partisan sites. About 31% of the
      left-leaning and 40% of the right-leaning sites had highest
      individual Alexa Ranks between Nov 2016 (when the election
      took place) to Feb 2017 (date when Trump moved into the White
      House). Again, we note that a disproportionately large number
      of conservative websites peaked and declined in popularity
      after this period.</p>
      <p>These results indicate that the traffic to these
      hyper-partisan sites is co-incident with the US elections.
      There could be several possible explanations. For instance,
      it may be that some websites were run by foreign actors or
      other agents with an explicit interest in promoting partisan
      news during the US elections, but stopped promoting their
      sites after the elections as it was no longer necessary. A
      second possibility is that the website owners were
      financially motivated and the sites were no longer as
      valuable after the elections. Alternately, the consumers of
      this content were more interested during the closely fought
      elections and lost interest afterwards. Our data can only
      observe the correlation of the website registrations and peak
      popularity with the election cycle, and cannot distinguish
      between these different possibilities.</p>

      <p>We focused our analysis on five aspects of demographics
      namely age, education, ethnicity, income and gender. We
      visualize these patterns through a series of bar plots. The X
      axis represents the demographic bracket and the Y axis the
      sampled mean audience count (normalized to 100 for the
      general Internet population, as shown in Table&nbsp;<a class=
      "tbl" href="#tab4">4</a>) across all the left- or right-
      leaning websites. All bar plots are shown with standard
      error.</p>
      <p>As expected from other surveys&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>] that suggests younger
      people are less politically engaged, Figure&nbsp;3a shows
      that those aged 45 and younger are under-represented relative
      to the rest of the Internet population, and those above 45
      over-represented. Interestingly, the under-represented
      populations are nearly equally left- and right-leaning, but
      the difference between left and right also grows with age.
      Partisan news consumers amongst the young (25 to 34) and the
      oldest (65+) age groups tend to be more liberal, while the
      middle-aged and older consumers (45 to 64) are more
      conservatively inclined. These findings are generally in line
      with conventional wisdom&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>] and think tanks according to which
      older people tend to be more conservative than their younger
      counterparts.</p>
      <p>However, among the 65+ age group that show maximum
      engagement in partisan news, there are relatively more
      liberal than conservative consumers. This could potentially
      be explained by the “tree ring” hypothesis, which contends
      that reaching young adulthood during certain historical
      periods has an effect on lifelong attitudes. In particular,
      increased liberalism among Americans who reached young
      adulthood (defined as age 16) in the 1960s (and are therefore
      currently 65+) has been confirmed with evidence from the
      General Social Survey&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>].</p>
      <p>Figure&nbsp;3b shows that people with no college education
      do not engage much with partisan news. Those with the most
      common educational attainment level (some college) have
      significantly higher affinity with right-leaning sites than
      left-leaning ones. On the other hand, people with a higher
      educational background (those who have completed a college or
      graduate degree) are active consumers of partisan websites,
      and tend to be left-inclined. We also notice that people with
      very high levels of education (Graduate School) are less
      represented than those with some college&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>].</p>
      <p>As expected from the SocioEconomic Status
      theory&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>],
      Figure&nbsp;3c indicates that people from economically weaker
      backgrounds do not tend to participate politcally and are
      overall less represented (i.e., have lower demographic
      scores) on partisan websites. We observe that people in the
      <font style="normal">$</font>30-60k and <font style=
      "normal">$</font>100k+ income brackets are over-represented
      with nearly equal distributions of left-leaning and
      right-leaning readership. However, the upper middle-class
      audience (with income in the range <font style=
      "normal">$</font>60-100k) is more inclined towards
      conservative news. This is the most common income range in
      the USA and includes roughly 1 in 3 households in the
      USA<a class="fn" href="#fn9" id=
      "foot-fn9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3d</a> shows the
      racial distribution of consumers of partisan websites.
      Caucasians represent an overwhelming majority of consumers as
      expected. Caucasian, Hispanic and Other audience is somewhat
      equally divided between left-wing and right-wing.
      African-Americans are found to be more left-leaning. We note
      that African, Asian, and Middle Eastern communities are
      under-represented for partisan websites in comparison with
      the rest of the Internet population; thus the audience for
      hyper partisan websites appears to be white caucasians.</p>
      <p>We also note (no figure included) that females are
      underrepresented amongst visitors to our list of partisan
      websites, and those that follow such websites are more
      left-leaning. We conjecture this is due to Hilary Clinton
      becoming the first female candidate to be nominated for
      president by a major U.S. political party (The Democrats).
      Male readers are over-represented for both conservative and
      liberal websites, but there is a higher inclination towards
      conservative news. The increased male support for
      conservative positions and candidates has been observed in
      several places (e.g., The Guardian [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] and Washington Post
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]) and the
      results also resonate with several surveys (e.g., Pew
      Internet Research&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]).</p>
      <p>In summary, the demographics study identifies an increased
      representation of conservative-leaning audiences in the most
      common demographic categories for education, income and
      ethnicity. Furthermore, many of the more engaged (i.e.,
      demographic score &gt; 110) age ranges also tend to be right
      leaning. The only highly engaged demographic group which is
      left leaning is the 65+ age range (≈ 15% of the US
      population).</p>

        <p>According to Alexa, upstream sites are sites that the
        visitors of a website visit immediately before visiting it.
        These are obtained using a diverse range of browser
        extensions and plugins from Alexa's measurement panel.
        Depending on availability of statistics, Alexa lists up to
        5 top upstream referers to each website. We use Alexa's
        list to understand who drives traffic to the partisan sites
        dataset. Upstream data is available for 484 of the 668
        partisan websites. Of these, 70% (339) are right leaning,
        and 30% (145) are left leaning.</p>
        <p>As a baseline, we also examine the distribution of

        <p>We divide the upstream referers into five broad
        categories as described in Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
        "#tab5">5</a>. As with many other websites, search engines
        and social networks such as Facebook are the main referers,
        apart from YouTube, which contributes a small but
        significant minority. The remaining two categories are
        ‘internal’ and ‘external’. We define internal upstream
        referers as other sites within the same category. Thus, the
        internal referers for partisan websites are other partisan
        websites; internal referers for mainstream news websites
        are other mainstream news websites. The external category
        captures all sites which are not otherwise categorised
        (i.e., all non-internal, non-social and non search-engine
        and non YouTube websites).</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> shows that
        social networks and search engines are the top drivers of
        traffic to both partisan as well as mainstream news
        websites. However, partisan websites have a
        disproportionately large amount of internal referrals. The
        Internal category consisting of 14.7% of partisan upstream
        sites that drive traffic among themselves together form the
        3rd largest source of traffic to partisan sites as shown in
        Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>. The share of
        traffic from the internal linkage between partisan websites
        is higher than many traditional drivers of internet traffic
        such as Twitter (9.3%) and YouTube (9%). We find this trend
        to be consistent for both left- and right-leaning websites
        (right-left split not shown in figure).</p>
        <p>Moreover, the share of internal upstream referers is 1.6
        times higher in partisan websites than mainstream news
        sites. In terms of individual numbers, nearly half (46%) of
        the unique upstream sites to partisan websites are
        internal, in contrast to the case of mainstream websites
        where only 23% of upstream sites are internal. These
        evidences point to an echo chamber of sorts amongst
        partisan websites which are driving traffic amongst each
        other, which we investigate further.</p>

        <p>We previously observed in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig"
        href="#fig4">4</a> that internal referers are a significant
        driver of traffic to partisan websites. We further break
        down such referring by political inclinations of the
        partisan websites to illuminate traffic flows among left
        and right websites. To test if we see any peculiar internal
        linking among left- and right-leaning websites we plotted
        the instances where a left-leaning partisan site links to a
        left-leaning site, and right-leaning one links to another
        right-leaning site. We also look at sites that link across
        the partisaan divide (i.e., a right-leaning site linking to
        a left-leaning website and vice versa).</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a> shows that
        internal referrals are clearly split along party
        lines—there is a very significant amount of internal
        referrals within the right as well as within the left but
        very little referrals from left to right or right to left.
        Indeed, there are 208 instances of a right partisan website
        being a top-5 referer to another right partisan website,
        and 59 instances of a left partisan website being a top-5
        referer to another left partisan website, in comparison to
        the single digit number of instances where a left site is a
        top-5 referer for a right-leaning site or vice versa. In
        total, partisan referrals between right-right or left-left
        account for 267/273 internal traffic referrals, i.e., ≈ 98%
        of referrals between websites in our dataset happen within
        their own biased part of the political spectrum.</p>
        <p>Internal referrals appear to be more prevalent on the
        right: As mentioned in §<a class="sec" href=
        "#sec-19">6.1</a>, upstream traffic data is available for
        339 (145) sites on the right (left). Of these, 139 (46)
        right (left) sites receive internal referrals according to
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a>. In other
        words, 41% of sites on the right benefit from receiving
        internal referrals as opposed to 31.7% of sites on the
        left—internal referrals are 1.3 times more prevalent on the
        right than on the left.</p>
        <p>This result highlights the existence of echo chambers
        among partisan websites in general, and conservative
        websites in particular. Such referral structures might
        serve to further reinforce and promote partisan
        micro-cultures.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>To discover the most influential partisan domains we
        modelled the partisan sites as a network where an edge is
        drawn from one website A to another website B if A is a
        top-5 referer of B. Thus, we obtain a graph with a maximum
        in-degree of 5. We draw this graph in Figure&nbsp;<a class=
        "fig" href="#fig6">6</a>, with right (left) leaning sites
        coloured as red (blue), and the size of the labels is
        proportional to the out-degree of the node, i.e., the size
        of a node A is proportional to the number of other sites on
        whose top-5 referer lists A appears. This figure clearly
        visualises the separation between right and left leaning
        sites. This is confirmed by running the Louvain method for
        community detection, which achieves a modularity value of
        0.69, indicative of an extremely strong community
        structure, with dense links within nodes in the same
        community and few links across communities.</p>
        <p>We next move to identify the important players that send
        traffic to other sites, as the nodes with the largest
        number of outgoing edges, and the important beneficiaries
        as the nodes with the largest number of incoming internal
        edges. Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab6">6</a> lists the
        top 10 partisan sites with the largest outgoing and
        incoming links. Considering the ratio of right to left
        sites in our dataset (§<a class="sec" href="#sec-7">3</a>),
        we expect right-leaning sites to comprise ≈ 70% of the
        lists. While we see the expected number of left-leaning
        sites amongst the sites with the most incoming links, the
        preponderance of right-leaning sites in the list of sites
        with the most outgoing links suggests the right has a
        monopoly on forward traffic referrals.</p>

      <p>Many of the partisan websites in our dataset also have
      corresponding Facebook pages, with some of them having
      millions of followers. The social features of Facebook pages
      allows us to provide a more complete, yet different picture
      of the hyper-partisan news ecosystem: Rather than having to
      infer traffic referrals from Alexa summaries, we can identify
      which pages ‘like’ which other page. Users who interact
      through comments and likes on Facebook pages can be
      identified, allowing us to directly examine the consumers of
      hyper partisan content. Short URLs such as bit.ly links are
      used on some Facebook pages. By tracking these links, we can
      identify engagement beyond comments and likes to measure
      click-through rates. Together, these studies paint a picture
      of the consumers of hyper partisan news as highly engaged but
      separated communities.</p>

        <p>Our investigation of upstream sites and their internal

        structure of the partisan news web. However, this traffic
        referral had to be inferred through Alexa data, and the

        were available through Alexa. By contrast, Facebook pages
        can explicitly ‘like’ other pages, which allows us to infer

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>To understand user engagement with these pages, we focus
        on the top 10 pages on the left and right with the most
        number of followers. In each page, we then identify 100
        posts with the highest number of reactions. In this manner,
        we create a corpus of 10*100 = 1000 posts on the left, and
        a similar number on the right. For each post, we identify
        up to 1000 users (API limit) who have liked the post. Thus,
        we identify up to 1000*100 = 100, 000 users who have liked
        posts on each Facebook page.</p>
        <p>With this data, we ask what is the overlap between the
        left and the right. We randomly pick <em>k</em> = 2 pages
        on the left and right respectively. We then take the set of
        users who have interacted with the top 100 posts on the
        <em>k</em> = 2 pages on the left and the set of users who
        have interacted with the top 100 posts on each of the
        <em>k</em> = 2 pages on the right, and compute their
        intersection, finding the number of users who are common.
        We may similarly compute the left-left and right-right
        overlap, finding users who have interacted with <em>k</em>
        = 2 pages on the left (right). This process can be repeated
        for <em>k</em> = 2, 3, 4…10. Note that for any given
        <em>k</em>, the number of pages involved in a left-left or
        right-right interaction is <em>k</em>, whereas the number
        of pages involved in a left-right interaction is
        2<em>k</em>, thus offering <em>more</em> opportunity for
        users to interact.</p>
        <p>Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig8">8</a> shows the
        result of computing the overlap between pages using this
        process. As <em>k</em> increases, the number of users who
        are common across all <em>k</em> sites drops, and the
        values become too small to report after <em>k</em> = 4. We
        also observe a left-left and right-right bias, wherein
        there is significantly more overlap of users who interact
        with pages all from the left or all from the right, than
        with pages from both the left and the right. While it is
        expected that the number of users who interact with
        <em>k</em> different pages drops as <em>k</em> increases,
        the significant difference between left-left and
        right-right interactions on the one hand and left-right
        interactions on the other hand again points to a hyper
        partisan <em>audience</em>, similar to the hyper partisan
        links found between <em>producers</em>.</p>

        <p>The 4 Million posts that we obtained by crawling across
        507 partisan pages, fall into three distinct categories.
        They are embedded URLs (84.5%), photos (11%) and videos
        (3.7%). We also find that 6% of the embedded URLs are
        shortened URLs, shortened by services like <tt>bit.ly</tt>
        or <tt>goo.gl</tt>. <em>Tea Party</em>, <em>ClashDaily.com
        with Doug Giles</em> and <em>American Thinker</em> are the
        top 3 pages with maximum number of short-urls (&gt; 15, 000
        each). Finding <tt>bit.ly</tt> shortened URLs allowed us to
        track the click through rates of these shortened URLs using
        the <tt>bit.ly</tt> API. In order to understand whether the
        Facebook users actually engage and if they do click through
        short URLs such as <tt>bit.ly</tt>, we crawled the clicks
        data for about 25 thousand short URLs belonging to 216
        pages. The Fig. <a class="fig" href="#fig9">9</a> shows the
        CDF of reactions on a facebook post with an embedded URL,
        and the click through for these URLs. Interestingly we note
        that click through is much higher than reactions on
        facebook. Also we found that the two variables are
        positively correlated (R = 0.26, p &lt;&lt; 10<sup>−

      <p>Hyper-partisan news media has been proven to be a major
      component in fake news proliferation<a class="fn" href=
      "#fn13" id="foot-fn13"><sup>13</sup></a>. In this study, we
      used a journalist-curated set of 668 hyper-partisan websites
      related to US News, and their associated Facebook pages, to
      characterise in depth the websites that produce
      hyper-partisan content, and the consumers of this content. We
      also answered two questions which have not been examined
      until now: how does traffic get directed towards partisan
      websites, and how do users engage with these websites.</p>
      <p>It was found that many of the websites, especially
      right-wing ones, were set up in 2016 during the run up to the
      US elections, and their Alexa traffic ranks declined after
      the Trump elections. This quick birth and death process casts
      some doubt on the role of these sites as purveyors of ‘news’
      – rather they appear to be makeshift platforms for
      distributing content when it was important to do so, or when
      there was a willing audience with an appetite for partisan
      politics. Our data-driven approach can only uncover the
      correlation of these websites’ lifetimes with the US
      election. Pinning down the cause for this would be an
      interesting avenue for future research.</p>
      <p>We analysed the demographics of the audience of partisan
      websites, and observed an increased propensity for
      conservatism amongst the most populous demographic groups
      (e.g., Caucasians, middle income group, and average
      educational attainment), which points to increased interest
      in and potentially support for right wing causes. Analysis of
      traffic patterns over these partisan sites helped us uncover
      tightly interlinked communities of a partisan nature, which
      also showed evidence of echo chambers among producers of
      news, similar to ones observed amongst consumers
      previously.</p>
      <p>Overall, this study revealed that the way traffic,
      information and users are forwarded amongst hyperpartisan
      sites might be aiding, or worse, widening the highly polar
      nature of news media. Our study is not without limitations:
      As mentioned, a data-driven study such as this cannot uncover
      causal relationships. The dataset itself has been curated
      carefully, and to our knowledge, is the largest list of
      partisan websites. However, our conclusions may not
      generalise beyond those sites active in the 2016 US
      Elections, or to partisan sites in other geographies.
      Finally, although Alexa provides several hints and
      reassurances about the quality of data (see text and
      footnotes earlier), it does not fully reveal the methodology
      it uses, which makes it harder to understand the true
      potential or limitations of some of our results which rely on
      this data.</p>

    this paper, we interchangeably use the words <em>partisan</em>
    and <em>hyper-partisan</em> in connection with websites in this

    was made by journalists at Buzzfeed News as part of a careful
    and impartial manual coding process. This is standard social
