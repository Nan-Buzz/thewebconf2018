      <p>Educational quizzes have become a popular tool that allows
      students or learners to discover and deepen their knowledge
      about a specific subject in an informal and entertaining way.
      According to the authors in [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>], their generation can be automated
      taking advantage of Semantic Web technologies and the Linked
      Open Data (LOD). However, being able to generate quizzes from
      resources of the LOD about a specific subject with questions
      relevant to the educational level of each student, is still
      an open research problem.</p>
      <p>In this context, the research work described in this paper
      provides an answer to the following research questions:</p>
      <ol class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="(1)">How to select resources from the
        LOD on a specific subject and relevant to a specific school
        level?<br /></li>
        <li id="list2" label="(2)">Which referential of knowledge
        and skills is the most appropriate for the selection of
        suitable resources from the LOD?<br /></li>
        <li id="list3" label="(3)">Which approach to use for the
        generation of quizzes about a subject, that takes into
        account the school level of a student?<br /></li>
      </ol>
      <p>In this research work, the use of a referential of
      knowledge and skills for the selection of relevant resources
      according to the existing school levels in France is
      considered. For this, we evaluate two existing educational
      references to determine which one allows to select the most
      relevant LOD resources from DBpedia France of a given subject
      and for different school courses. Finally, we describe an
      approach on how to perform the generation of the quizzes
      based on the selected referential.</p>
      <p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In
      section <a class="sec" href="#sec-4">2</a>, we present the
      related works. In section <a class="sec" href="#sec-7">3</a>,
      we present two structured knowledge bases that can be used as
      a standard of the required knowledge and skills in the French
      educational system by school year. In section <a class="sec"
      href="#sec-10">4</a>, we describe how, by analyzing such
      knowledge bases, we can generate a knowledge graph from
      DBpedia, with resources that can be useful to produce quizzes
      automatically. In section <a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-11">5</a>, we briefly describe the principle of the
      automatic generation of quizzes from such knowledge graphs.
      In section <a class="sec" href="#sec-12">6</a>, we describe
      the implementation and evaluation of the knowledge graphs and
      the quizzes generated from them. Conclusions and future work
      are presented in Section <a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-15">7</a>.</p>

        <p>In&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>], the authors provide a literature
        survey of the development and use of ontologies in the
        domain of e-learning systems. Among such works, CURONTO
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] is “an
        ontological model designed for the management of a
        curriculum and to facilite program review and assessment”.
        However, it does not provide a description or
        representation of the knowledge and skills required by an
        educational system.</p>
        <p>Gescur [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>] is a tool dedicated to the
        management and evaluation of the implementation of the
        curriculum, which facilitates the curriculum management
        process”. It relies on an ontology of concepts relevant to
        curriculum management in Secondary Schools, such as
        teachers, departments, objectives, subjects, modules,
        tasks, documents, policies, activities, learning objects,
        quality criteria, etc. This tool does not focus on the
        management of the knowledge and skills in educational
        systems.</p>
        <p>An educational semantic web ontology is proposed in
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>]. It
        focuses on representing higher education concepts and
        assisting specialized e-learning systems.</p>
        <p>In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>], the authors propose OntoEdu, an
        educational platform architecture for e-Learning which
        relies on an activity ontology that describes all the
        education activities and the relations among them, and a
        material ontology which describes the educational content
        organization. Unfortunately this ontology is not available
        online.</p>
        <p>Finally, in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>], the authors present
        EduProgression, an ontological model for educational
        progressions, formalized in OWL, which is based on the
        modeling of the knowledge and skills of an educational
        system according to its different educational levels.
        Likewise this ontology is currently populated with the
        progressions of the French educational system for the
        subjects of History, Geography and Experimental Sciences
        and Technology.</p>

        <p>A set of strategies for the generation of questions,
        answers and distractors from a given ontology is proposed
        in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. The strategies proposed in this
        work are classified into three categories: class-based,
        property-based and terminology-based. As it will be
        explained, our automatic generation of quizzes was inspired
        on this work. Furthermore, we proposed a new classification
        of the strategies to generate quizzes that authors
        propose.</p>
        <p>In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], the authors present an approach
        for automatically generating computer-assisted assessments
        (CAA) from Semantic Web-based domain ontologies. They
        propose the addition of annotations to the meta-ontology
        used for the generation of questions and the addition of a
        semantic interpretation of the mapping between the
        <em>domain ontology</em> and the target <em>question
        ontology</em>. The semantic interpretation is based on the
        notion of <em>question templates</em> found on the Bloom's
        taxonomy of educational objectives.However, this work does
        not take into account the generation of questions oriented
        to a specific educational level.</p>
        <p>The OntoQue system is dedicated to the generation of
        objective assessment items based on domain ontologies
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. It uses
        knowledge inherent in the ontology about classes,
        properties, and individuals to generate semantically
        correct assessment items. Its authors evaluated the system
        with four OWL ontologies from different domains. Unlike
        this work, we propose a broader automatic approach that
        exploits the knowledge present in DBpedia, and which can be
        adapted to other knowledge bases or ontologies. In
        addition, our approach is based on the use of an
        educational reference to generate more specific questions
        according to the level of the learner.</p>
        <p>In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>], the authors propose an approach
        to generate educational assessment items using Linked Open
        Data (DBpedia). They describe a streamline to create
        variables and populate simple choice item models using the
        IMS-QTI standard. A set of specific categories common to a
        set of resources is statically selected, from which
        questions, answers and distractors will be generated using
        SPARQL queries. Unlike our work prooposed in this paper,
        this work is not based on any educational reference and
        also does not propose an automatic approach.</p>
        <p>In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>], the authors present an approach
        for the validation of ontologies which abstracts the
        complexity of formal languages by using a set of questions
        and answers to which the expert is subjected. The aim is to
        validate the conceptualization of the domain. Automatic
        reasoning and verbalization techniques are used to
        transform the facts present in an ontology into questions
        expressed in natural language, to be evaluated by a domain
        expert. The answer to each of these questions is then
        processed to automatically validate or correct the
        ontology. Unlike this approach, ours has not (yet) been
        evaluated for the validation of domain ontologies.</p>
        <p>In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>], the authors present an approach to
        the automatic generation of Multiple Choice Questions
        (MCQs), based on the unsupervised Relation Extraction
        technique used in Natural Language Processing. It aims to
        identify the most important named entities and terminology
        in a document and then recognize semantic relations between
        them, without any prior knowledge as to the semantic types
        of the relations or their specific linguistic realization.
        In contrast, our approach is not based only domain
        ontologies, but it also allows to describe and define a
        specific domain of knowledge and exploit the knowledge
        found in knowledge bases such as DBpedia for the automatic
        generation of questions following educational
        references.</p>
        <p>In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>,
        <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>], the
        authors present an approach to automatically generate
        multiple-choice questions from OWL ontologies. They
        describe a psychologically-plausible theory based on
        similarity [10] to control the difficulty of questions.
        They also describe a protocol to evaluate the
        characteristics of the generated questions such as the
        question difficulty. Unlike this work, we have not yet
        considered the determination of the difficulty of the
        generated questions. Without a doubt, this is an aspect
        that we will deal with in future works.</p>

        formalized in the standard Ontology Web Language (OWL) for
        the formalization of educational progressions or programs
        as defined in the French common bases of 2006 [<a class=

        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] and 2016.
        In this formalization, we identified the following main

            <strong>Element of Knowledge and Skills (EKS).</strong>
            As skills and knowledge are keystones of the common
            bases, this element is the key concept of our model. It
            is represented by the EKS class, which is the central
            class of the EduProgression ontology. This class is
            common for the two releases of the common base.<br />
            An element of knowledge and skills is associated to a

        engine to generate quizzes containing multiple-choice
        questions, with their answers and distractors, by initially
        taking as a reference the topics and the information
        currently present in the limited dataset of questions of
        <em>Les Incollables</em><a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=

        <p><em>Les Incollables</em> is a world-famous questions
        game in French, targeted mainly to contribute to educate
        children and young people by playing. A large amount of the
        questions of the game are multiple-choice questions, which
        have been originally created manually by domain experts and
        written on paper cards and several non-digital formats.
        These questions have been created considering the different
        school levels of the French educational system.</p>
        <p>As part of this project, around 160,000 questions of the
        game belonging to 6 French school courses (<em>CP</em>,
        <em>CE1</em>, <em>CE2</em>, <em>CM1</em>, <em>CM2</em> and
        <em>6<sup>e</sup></em> ) have been subjected to a
        digitization process. This digitization process included
        OCR from game cards, scanned documents and existing images
        containing the questions. Once digitized, these questions
        were represented and described by means of OWL ontologies
        and stored in a structured data format (RDF). The OWL

          <h2><span class="section-number">4</span> Extraction of a
          Knowledge Graph from DBpedia According to the Educational
          Standards</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The selection of resources from a dataset that are
      relevant to the topics of a subject for a specific school
      year according to an educational standard, is the basis for
      automatically generating useful quizzes for the learners.
      Since the knowledge bases on the Semantic Web use different
      ontologies and ways of structuring their data, we decided to
      focus our study on DBpedia, which is one of the most used
      knowledge bases available on the Linked Open Data and
      provides a large amount of resources from different
      domains.</p>
      <p>To extract a subset from DBpedia that contains knowledge
      from a specific domain and a school year (to which we refer
      to as a <em>knowledge graph</em>), our approach is as
      follows: We start by analyzing the keywords of the
      competences and skills defined in each knowledge base of an
      educational standard corresponding to the targeted domain and
      school year. Then, from these keywords, we extract an initial
      set of DBpedia named entities <em>R</em> and we enrich it
      with the <em>wikilinks</em> of the extracted resources having
      relevant categories. For this, we build a set of categories
      <em>C</em> with the result of a dedicated SPARQL query on
      DBpedia searching for the value of the
      <em>dcterms:subject</em> property or
      <em>dcterms:subject/skos:broader</em> property path of each
      resource in <em>R</em>. Then we restrict to the subset of
      <em>C</em> limited to the <em>k</em> categories having the
      most related resources. We consider <em>C<sub>topK</sub></em>
      as the set of the most relevant categories and therefore the
      wikilinks of the resources in <em>R</em> which have a
      category in <em>C<sub>topK</sub></em> are added to
      <em>R</em>. The value of the number of categories <em>k</em>
      is determined by a manual analysis of the relevance of the
      categories with respect to the domain, allowing to discard
      some categories that may not be relevant to the targeted
      domain. Finally the set of triples describing the resources
      in <em>R</em> are stored in a named graph <em>NG</em>.</p>

      class="img-responsive" alt="" longdesc="" /></p>
      <p>The main advantage of this heuristics is that it enables
      to discover relevant related resources from DBpedia and it
      limits the number of non-relevant resources that may be added
      through a category-based filter.</p>
      <p>By means of a simple SPARQL like the one shown, it is
      possible to retrieve all the DBpedia resources contained in
      the generated knowledge graph:</p>

      to automatically generate quizzes from knowledge bases on the
      Web of Data, that relies on the work of [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>] on the generation of
      multiple choice questions from domain ontologies through
      queries. We proposed a new classification of the strategies
      to generate quizzes. The first column of Table&nbsp;<a class=
      "tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> lists all the categories of
      strategies to generate quizzes. As it can be seen on this
      table, each category corresponds to a type of targeted
      question to be generated; and to achieve it, the expected
      output is a special kind of RDF triple which should be
      retrieved from a knowledge graph, by using a predefined
      SPARQL query template.</p>

      <p>In order to comparatively evaluate the two reference

        <p>In order to assess the relevance of the resources

        that is, 100 resources per each base merged to avoid

        <p>Finally, we have asked the geography teacher to evaluate
        the relevance of the questions generated from each
        educational reference (on a scale of one to 5, where 5 is
        the most relevant). For this, he has been given a list of

        <p>From these results it can be interpreted that the
        questions generated from the DBpedia resources extracted
        from the educational reference ”EduProgression” were
        evaluated with a higher average score of relevance with
        respect to ”Les Incollables”. These results are consistent
        with the assessed relevance of the evaluated resources
        extracted from each educational reference.</p>

          Future Work</h2>

      <p>In this paper, we have presented an approach to the
      automatic generation of quizzes about a specific subject,
      that takes into a account the school level of the target
      student. Through an educational reference, our approach is
      able to extract resources from the LOD (corresponding to a
      specific subject and a specific school year) from which the
      quizzes are generated. We have presented two structured
      educational references: <em>EduProgression</em> and <em>Les
      Incollables</em> and we have evaluated them in order to
      determine from which one it is possible to extract more
      relevant resources and quizzes. From the evaluation made by a
      geography teacher to resources and quizzes of geography for
      the CM2 school level, we were able to conclude that
      <em>EduProgression</em> was the educational reference that
      allowed generating resources and quizzes of greater
      relevance. However, as future work, we plan to extend our
      evaluation by taking into account quizzes generated for other
      school courses and subjects, and also by involving more
      professors. Future work also includes extracting resources
      from other linked data sources and not just from DBpedia.
      Finally, we think about improving our heuristic for the
      selection of related resources, also giving the possibility
      to the generator of quizzes, to manually select the
      categories from which to filter the related resources.</p>
