      <div class="abstract">
        <p><small>The Web's content has been going through major
        changes, triggered by multiple factors including changes in
        user demographic and authoring behaviour, a shift in device
        types that access the Web, and changes in common use cases
        of the Web. More specifically, the number of mobile
        internet users has surpassed the desktop users according to
        different statistics; a considerable portion of web use
        cases are in the form of social interactions rather than
        information seeking; and the authoring behaviour has
        transformed from compiling a page and linking resources to
        sharing content with like-minded followers and leaving
        likes and comments on posts. Those changes have influenced
        and are expected to shape the way the content is organized,
        searched, ranked and analyzed.</small></p>
        <p><small>This panel brings together researchers who have
        been working in different established areas related to web
        search and mining, web content and social network analysis,
        and semantics and knowledge management. The panel will draw
        from the experience of the panellists, dealing with changes
        in their respective fields. In the first (role-playing)
        round, each panellist will strongly take a side on where
        the changes are heading, arguing that one form of content
        will dominate in the near future. In the second round, the
        panellists will counter each other and will share their
        vision on what future holds in terms of research problems
        and directions. The members of the audience will
        participate, in a QA session with the panellists, bringing
        their own perspectives to the discussion.</small></p>

          <h2>Overview of the Panel</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The topic of the panel, as discussed in the abstract, is
      relevant to multiple research tracks in the conference. Those
      tracks have been going through some changes and those changes
      are expected to continue. This panel provides a forum to
      discuss the forces behind those changes and to gain a better
      understanding of implications for future research and
      directions. Here are some of the questions that will put
      forward to the panelists:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="•">How has the content been changing
        for the past two decades and how have those changes been
        affecting the research and practice in web search and
        mining?<br /></li>
        <li id="list2" label="•">How are personalization, “ the
        filter bubble” and conversational and intelligent
        assistants affecting search? What are some of the long-term
        effects?<br /></li>
        <li id="list3" label="•">Different forms of content have
        been making headlines over the past two decades, with
        examples including HTML pages, micro-blog posts, social
        networks, linked data, curated content (e.g., Wikipedia),
        and annotated documents (e.g., with named entities
        resolved). What form of content is expected to dominate web
        search results and mining practices over the next 5-10
        years?<br /></li>
        <li id="list4" label="•">What are the implications of all
        these changes for work in web search and mining?</li>
      </ul>
