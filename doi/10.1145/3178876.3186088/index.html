        factors likely contribute to these misconceptions. In this

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Each of the five web browsers widely used today — Chrome,
      Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera — offers a private mode that
      stops storing browsing history and caching data across
      sessions. Unwanted information from the user's browsing
      history will not appear in the history bar, auto-filled
      forms, or search suggestions. Private modes thus help users
      hide browsing sessions from people sharing a device with
      them.</p>
      <p>While these private modes aim not to save user data
      locally, many threats to privacy are outside their scope. For
      example, private mode does not aim to prevent tracking over
      the network. While browser cookies do not persist across
      private browsing sessions, this is a minor barrier to
      tracking by third-party advertising and analytics companies,
      who can employ more sophisticated fingerprinting
      techniques&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. Furthermore, implementations are
      imperfect, often leaving some traces of local
      activity&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0047">47</a>].</p>
      <p>Despite the limited protections private modes provide,
      some users overestimate these protections&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. This
      overestimation reaches far; Eric Schmidt, former CEO of
      Google, once stated, “If you're concerned, for whatever
      reason, you do not wish to be tracked by federal and state
      authorities, my strong recommendation is to use incognito
      mode, and that's what people do”&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>].</p>
      <p>In this paper, we take initial steps toward unpacking
      these misconceptions by conducting a user study of how
      browsers’ own explanations of private mode impact users’
      understanding of what these modes do. Browsers differ in how
      they explain private mode; even the mode's name differs
      (e.g., “Incognito Mode” in Chrome, “InPrivate” in Edge, and
      “Private Browsing Mode” in Firefox). We focus on the
      <em>disclosure</em>, or full-page explanation browsers
      present when users open a new window in <em>private mode</em>
      (the catch-all term we use across browsers). Notably,
      disclosures often differ between a given browser's desktop
      and mobile versions.</p>
      <p>We conducted a between-subjects online study in which 460
      participants each saw one of 13 different disclosures (the
      desktop and mobile disclosures of six popular browsers, plus
      a control disclosure) rebranded for a hypothetical new
      browser. Participants answered questions about what would
      happen in twenty different browsing scenarios. In some of
      these scenarios, private mode protects the user's privacy,
      while the other scenarios encapsulate previously documented
      misconceptions&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>] about private mode.</p>
      <p>We found that participants had many misconceptions,
      including beliefs that private mode would prevent
      geolocation, protect from malware, eliminate advertisements,
      and prevent tracking by the websites visited and network
      providers. The particular disclosure participants saw
      impacted their misconceptions. Compared to a meaninglessly
      vague control condition, the current and previous Chrome
      desktop disclosure led participants to answer more scenarios
      correctly; no other disclosure we tested had a significant
      effect. Participants who saw certain disclosures were more
      likely to have misconceptions about private mode's impact on
      specific scenarios: targeted advertising, the persistence of
      lists of downloaded files, and tracking by Internet service
      providers (ISPs), employers, and governments. Phrases used in
      some disclosures (e.g., “tracking protection”) appear to
      contribute to misconceptions.</p>
      <p>While prior work has documented misconceptions about
      private mode, our study is the first to focus on the role
      browsers’ disclosures play. These disclosures, which users
      see each time they open a new private browsing window, are
      the main vector for disabusing users of misconceptions that
      might derive from loaded names like “private browsing mode”
      and “incognito mode”&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>]. While we found that some browsers’
      disclosures are better than others, all disclosures we tested
      failed to correct important misconceptions.</p>

            Private Browsing</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>All major web browsers include a private mode designed
        to protect against local privacy threats with physical
        access to a machine&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. These modes aim to remove local
        copies of browsing history, temporary files, and cookies
        from a machine. That said, the implementation of these
        features is imperfect&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. Xu et al. demonstrated that
        sophisticated attackers can still gain access to
        information from private sessions&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0047">47</a>]. Similarly, Satvat et
        al. found vulnerabilities that enable sophisticated
        attackers and malware to steal information from private
        mode&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>]. While such attacks are important
        to overall browser security, they are not the focus of our
        work. Instead, we study how users’ expectations compare to
        private mode's intended protections. To determine these
        intended protections, we examined both browser-specific
        documentation and prior research on private modes. For
        potential behaviors that were not formally documented, we
        conducted informal experiments.</p>
        <p>No browser intentionally stores browsing history from
        private mode after a session is closed&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>, <a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>, <a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>, <a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>, <a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>]. This guarantee does
        not at all apply to remote services; if a user is logged
        into an account, the provider of that account can certainly
        record the user's browsing activity&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. Browsers aim to delete
        temporary files (e.g., cached files) when private sessions
        are closed. All browsers except Edge launch private
        browsing with fresh cookie storage; Edge uses the store
        from standard mode. All browsers clear cookies after the
        private session is closed. Across browsers, autofill
        information from standard mode is available when using
        private mode, but no browser offers to save autofill
        details automatically&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>].</p>
        <p>Private mode does not, however, protect against remote
        threats. With one exception, browsers’ private modes do not
        alter the visibility of a user's IP address or otherwise
        change how traffic appears on the network. Only Opera's VPN
        feature&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>] provides some limited protection.
        While it hides browsing activities from users’ ISPs,
        Opera's VPN servers have the ability to snoop on their
        users’ browsing behavior. Between this limitation and the
        opt-in nature of Opera's VPN, this tool's ability to
        prevent tracking is limited for most users. Also,
        Firefox<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
        "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> and Opera VPN provide
        protection against common tracking networks. Private mode
        also does not aim to stop all local activity. Files
        downloaded in private sessions remain afterwards, while all
        browsers we tested other than Brave do not save the list of
        files downloaded in private mode. All browsers can access
        existing bookmarks in private mode, and new bookmarks saved
        in private mode are available in future
        sessions&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>].</p>
        <p>Browsers differ somewhat in their private modes. Chrome
        and Edge do not save preferences (e.g., pop-up blocking,
        download locations) from private sessions, while Firefox
        and Opera do. Browsers similarly differ in how they handle
        browser extensions. Edge completely disables extensions,
        while Firefox and Safari leave them enabled by default.
        Chrome and Opera disable extensions by default, but let
        users manually enable them.</p>

        </header>
        <p>To create the browsing scenarios for our study, we
        gathered misconceptions about private mode previously
        documented in the academic literature and news media. Two
        prior user studies have focused on misconceptions about
        private mode. Gao et al. surveyed 200 Mechanical Turk
        workers, examining qualitatively why participants used
        private browsing modes and what they believed the modes
        do&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. More recently, the search engine
        DuckDuckGo conducted a demographically representative
        sample of 5,710 Americans, documenting seven misconceptions
        about private browsing&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>].</p>
        <p>Prior work has found that some users incorrectly believe
        private mode shields them from tracking by visited
        websites, online advertising companies, the government, and

        <p>While we aimed to test all misconceptions documented in
        prior work, some were too vague to test in a controlled
        manner. For instance, the misconception “websites that I

        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>] could refer to websites
        associating pseudonymous activity from different browsing
        sessions, or it could refer to determining a user's
        real-world identity. Similarly, the misconception that
        “private browsing keeps my computer clean”&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>], could
        refer to any range of files being deleted upon exiting a

          Methodology</h2>

      </header>
      <p>We conducted an online survey of participants recruited
      through Amazon's Mechanical Turk service for “a research
      study on web browsing behavior.” Participants were paid
      <font style="normal">$</font>5 to complete the half-hour
      survey. We required that participants be 18 years or older,
      live in the United States, and have completed 100+ HITs with
      a 95%+ approval rating. Below, we present our overall survey
      structure followed by detailed descriptions of the thirteen
      conditions and twenty browsing scenarios we tested. Finally,
      we describe our quantitative and qualitative analysis
      methods.</p>

            Structure</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>We began by asking participants to imagine a new web
        browser called Onyx. We chose to use a hypothetical browser
        to minimize biases associated with perceptions of current
        browser vendors or prior experiences with a particular
        browser&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0044">44</a>]. We explained, “Onyx has a mode
        called private browsing mode. When you open a new private
        browsing mode window in Onyx, you see the screen below.” At
        this point, we presented a simulated browser window
        containing the disclosure specified by the participant's
        condition (detailed in Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
        "#sec-10">3.2</a>) and specified, “Please make sure to read
        the information presented below before continuing on to the
        rest of the survey.” We clarified that we used <em>Standard
        Mode</em> to mean “Onyx's default mode, which is modeled
        after the default browsing mode of current web browsers
        (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Safari).”
        Similarly we defined <em>Private Browsing Mode</em> as the
        “mode described on the previous page” so that participants
        would base their answers on the disclosure text.</p>
        <p>The main survey section presented twenty browsing
        scenarios (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
        "#sec-11">3.3</a>) in randomized order. These represented a
        mixture of situations in which private mode would have an
        effect and where it would not. We asked participants to
        assume an individual named Brian had opened a brand new
        computer and installed Onyx in its default configuration
        immediately prior to each scenario. We collected responses
        to both multiple-choice questions and a free-response
        question for each scenario. We provided a link to “reopen
        the disclosure in a new tab” on top of each page,
        instrumenting this link to record when participants
        reopened the disclosure. Finally, we asked participants
        demographic questions about age, gender, and technical
        background. We also asked about their usage of current
        browsers and their private modes.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Each participant was randomly assigned to one of
        thirteen conditions corresponding to a private browsing
        disclosure. All disclosures had a uniform design to prevent
        bias and differed only in the text displayed.
        Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> details the
        text of all thirteen disclosures.</p>
        <p>We took twelve of these disclosures verbatim from the
        respective landing pages of six major browsers. We chose
        the five most popular browsers–Chrome, Edge, Firefox,
        Safari, and Opera– and Brave because it is a relatively new
        browser explicitly designed for privacy. We tested the
        disclosure used on the Mac OS desktop version for all
        browsers other than Edge (Windows 10) as of August 2017. In
        addition, because Chrome's disclosure had been redesigned
        shortly before the beginning of the study, we included
        Chrome's previous disclosure. We also tested the mobile
        versions of these browsers, excluding Edge, whose mobile
        version was in beta at the time of research. In cases where
        mobile disclosures differed between Android and iOS, we
        tested the one that differed most from the desktop version.
        Finally, to understand what actionable information
        disclosures provided participants, we created a control
        condition that made meaninglessly vague assertions about
        protecting privacy.</p>

            Scenarios</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>We created twenty browsing scenarios to capture actual
        benefits and previously documented misconceptions of
        private mode&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. We tested nine where private
        browsing does not have any effect and six where it does,
        even if the protection is imperfect. We also included five
        scenarios where the effect of private browsing is browser-
        or context-dependent as perceptions of these scenarios
        color overall expectations of private mode. Scenarios took
        two main forms: distinguishing and comparative.</p>
        <p>Sixteen <em>distinguishing scenarios</em> measured
        differences participants perceived between standard mode
        and private mode. To do this, we constructed parallel
        yes-or-no questions about the browser feature in each mode
        and asked participants to explain why they chose the same
        or different responses across modes. We asked about
        standard and private mode separately to disambiguate
        misconceptions specific to private mode from broader
        misunderstandings.</p>
        <p>The following is an example set of questions for one
        scenario:</p>
        <ol class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list1" label="(1)">Imagine that, using Onyx in
          <strong>standard</strong> mode, Brian goes online
          shopping on FunFashion.com and adds two items to his
          shopping cart. Brian then closes Onyx. Brian then opens
          Onyx in <strong>standard</strong> mode. Will his items
          still be available in his shopping cart?<em>(Yes,
          No)</em><br /></li>
          <li id="list2" label="(2)">How confident are you in your
          answer to the previous question? <em>(Very confident,
          Confident, Somewhat confident, Not at all
          confident)</em><br /></li>
          <li id="list3" label="(3)">Imagine that, using Onyx in
          <strong>private</strong> mode, Brian goes online shopping
          on FunFashion.com and adds two items to his shopping
          cart. Brian then closes Onyx. Brian then opens Onyx in
          <strong>standard</strong> mode. Will his items still be
          available in his shopping cart?<em>(Yes,
          No)</em><br /></li>
          <li id="list4" label="(4)">How confident are you in your
          answer to the previous question? <em>(Very confident,
          Confident, Somewhat confident, Not at all
          confident)</em><br /></li>
          <li id="list5" label="(5)">If you chose the same answers
          for standard and private mode, why? If you chose
          different answers, why?<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>In addition to the persistence of shopping cart items,
        we presented distinguishing scenarios related to the
        persistence of browsing history, site pop-up preferences,
        bookmarks, the list of downloaded files, downloaded files
        themselves, and cached photos across sessions. To gauge
        perceptions related to tracking by the websites visited, we
        presented separate distinguishing scenarios about whether
        Google searches across browsing sessions can be associated
        with the same user if the user is, or is not, logged into a
        Google account. We also presented separate distinguishing
        scenarios regarding tracking from the following three
        entities: an Internet Service Provider (ISP), an employer
        (while using the employer's network), and government
        agencies. Other scenarios gauged perceptions about whether
        browser extensions would be active, IP addresses would be
        visible on the network, estimating geolocation was
        possible, and browsing history could be recovered by a
        forensics expert with physical access to the machine.</p>
        <p>The remaining four scenarios were more naturally
        expressed as a comparison between standard and private
        modes. In these four <em>comparative scenarios</em>, we
        asked participants to compare the relative incidence of
        some property between modes. For example, participants saw
        the following questions and multiple-choice responses for a
        scenario about the loading speed of webpages:</p>
        <ol class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list6" label="(1)">How will the speed at which
          webpages load compare in standard versus private browsing
          mode?<br />
            <ul class="list-no-style">
              <li id="list7" label="•"><em>They will load much more
              quickly in</em> <strong>private</strong> <em>mode
              than in standard mode.</em><br /></li>
              <li id="list8" label="•"><em>They will load more
              quickly in</em> <strong>private</strong>
              <em>...</em><br /></li>
              <li id="list9" label="•"><em>They will load a little
              more quickly in</em> <strong>private</strong>
              <em>...</em><br /></li>
              <li id="list10" label="•"><em>They will load at the
              same speed.</em><br /></li>
              <li id="list11" label="•"><em>They will load a little
              more quickly in</em> <strong>standard</strong>
              <em>...</em><br /></li>
              <li id="list12" label="•"><em>They will load more
              quickly in</em> <strong>standard</strong>
              <em>...</em><br /></li>
              <li id="list13" label="•"><em>They will load much
              more quickly in</em> <strong>standard</strong>
              <em>...</em><br /></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li id="list14" label="(2)">How confident are you in your
          answer...<br /></li>
          <li id="list15" label="(3)">Why?<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>In addition to loading speed, we also presented
        comparative scenarios about the total number of ads, the
        proportion of targeted ads based on prior browsing, and
        virus and other malware protection.</p>

            Quantitative Analysis</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>We aimed to understand to what degree the disclosures or
        demographic factors influenced the correctness of
        participants’ responses for all twenty scenarios in
        aggregate, as well as participants’ overall confidence in
        these responses. For each participant, we computed a
        <em>correctness score</em> by summing the number of
        scenarios for which their response was correct (comparative
        scenarios) or response about private mode was correct
        (distinguishing scenarios). The correct response differed
        based on the browser or the browsing context for six
        scenarios relating to the page loading speed, the
        persistence of domain-specific preferences, whether browser
        extensions are active, information extractable by a
        forensics expert, shopping carts, and the total number of
        ads. We excluded these six and calculated the correctness
        score from the fourteen remaining scenarios.</p>
        <p>We similarly created an overall <em>confidence
        score</em> per participant by summing that participants’
        self-reported confidence (0 through 3, from “not at all
        confident” through “very confident”) across the same
        scenarios as the correctness score. We created linear
        regression models with each of the scores as the dependent
        variable and the following independent variables: the
        condition; the number of times the participant reopened the
        disclosure; and the participants’ gender, age, technical
        expertise, and use of private mode.</p>
        <p>Our second type of quantitative analysis aimed to
        understand, at a finer-grained level, how the disclosure
        participants saw impacted each individual scenario (and
        thus the particular private browsing feature or
        misconception that scenario encodes). For each of the
        twenty scenarios, we conducted an omnibus test to determine
        whether responses about what would happen in private mode
        differed significantly depending on which of the 13
        disclosures the participant saw. We analyzed the yes/no
        responses for private mode in the sixteen distinguishing
        scenarios using Pearson's <em>χ</em> <sup>2</sup> test.
        When a contingency table contained an expected value below
        5, we used Fisher's exact test (FET). In the four
        comparative scenarios, our response variable was ordinal.
        Therefore, we used the nonparametric Kruskall-Wallis (KW) H
        test for our omnibus test across groups. We use <em>α</em>
        = .05 throughout. We correct for multiple testing using the
        Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p>
        <p>We chose 12 planned comparisons (equal to the degrees of
        freedom in our experiment) to investigate three targeted
        research questions. First, we investigated whether the
        widely-deployed disclosures led to significantly more
        correct conceptions of private mode compared to the control
        disclosure we created.</p>
        <p><strong>RQ 1</strong>: How do each of the six desktop
        disclosures compare to the control? To answer this, we
        performed the following six planned comparisons: Brave vs.
        Control; Chrome vs. Control; Edge vs. Control; Firefox vs.
        Control; Opera vs. Control; Safari vs. Control.</p>
        <p>We further noticed that the disclosure in the desktop
        versions tended to differ substantially from the same
        browsers’ mobile disclosures, which were often much
        shorter.</p>
        <p><strong>RQ 2</strong>: How do mobile versions of
        disclosures compare to the disclosure in the same browser's
        desktop version? To answer this, we performed the following
        five planned comparisons: Brave vs. Brave-Mobile; Chrome
        vs. Chrome-Mobile; Firefox vs. Firefox-Mobile; Opera vs.
        Opera-Mobile; Safari vs. Safari-Mobile.</p>
        <p>Finally, because Chrome's disclosure changed noticeably
        shortly before we performed our study, we investigated how
        this redesign impacted misconceptions.</p>
        <p><strong>RQ 3</strong>: How does the recently redesigned
        Chrome disclosure compare to the previous Chrome
        disclosure? To answer this, we performed the following
        planned comparison: Chrome vs. Chrome-Old.</p>
        <p>We only performed planned comparisons when the omnibus
        test was significant. For planned comparisons in the
        sixteen distinguishing scenarios, we again used Pearson's
        <em>χ</em> <sup>2</sup> test (or Fisher's exact test, as
        appropriate). For planned comparisons of ordinal responses
        in comparative scenarios, we used the Mann-Whitney U (MW)
        test.</p>

            Analysis</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>To gauge <em>why</em> participants had particular
        misconceptions, we performed qualitative coding for the
        seventeen scenarios at least 20% of participants answered
        incorrectly. For each of these scenarios, a member of the
        research team read the free-text explanations accompanying
        incorrect responses. The researcher subsequently performed
        open coding, iteratively updating the codebook as
        necessary. We followed a similar process to identify themes
        in the reasons participants gave for using private
        browsing. First, a member of the research team performed
        open coding to identify eighteen and twenty codes for
        desktop and mobile users, respectively. The researcher then
        used axial coding for consolidation and clarification,
        resulting in fifteen themes for desktop and sixteen for
        mobile. Codes were not mutually exclusive; participants
        could give multiple reasons for using private browsing.</p>
        <p>A second member of the research term independently coded
        all of the data following the codebook. Cohen's <em>κ</em>
        ranged from 0.651 to 0.860 per scenario, with a median of
        0.716. To focus on recurring themes, we only report codes
        that occurred for at least 10% of incorrect responses.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">4</span> Results</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>We first provide an overview of our 460 participants
      (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-15">4.1</a>) and, for
      those who used private mode in their daily browsing, the
      reasons they gave for doing so (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec"
      href="#sec-16">4.2</a>). Echoing prior work, we found that
      participants use private mode to hide browsing activity,
      prevent the saving of log-in information, and avoid cookies.
      Augmenting this prior work, we found that some participants
      used private mode to avoid ad targeting and web
      personalization.</p>
      <p>The remaining sections focus on how the disclosures
      impacted participants’ expectations for the twenty browsing
      scenarios. In Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-17">4.3</a>, we present the results of participants’
      correctness scores and confidence scores aggregated across
      scenarios. Compared to our control disclosure, participants
      who saw the Chrome or Chrome-Old disclosure gave
      significantly more correct responses. Surprisingly, no other
      disclosures we tested differed significantly from the
      meaningless control disclosure, and our results suggest that
      some disclosures may have led to additional
      misconceptions.</p>
      <p>To more fully understand the reason for incorrect
      responses, we delved into the twenty scenarios one at a time.
      For three scenarios, participants’ responses were
      overwhelmingly correct (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-18">4.4</a>). Unfortunately, participants overestimated
      the protections afforded by private mode for eight scenarios,
      whereas they underestimated the protections in three
      scenarios (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-19">4.5</a>). These misconceptions included
      expectations that private browsing mode would prevent
      geolocation, ads, and viruses, as well as tracking by both
      the websites visited and the network provider. For five of
      the twenty scenarios, participants’ responses differed
      significantly across disclosures. These five scenarios
      related to targeted advertising, the persistence of lists of
      downloaded files, and tracking by ISPs, employers, and
      governments.</p>

            Participants and Their Browser Usage</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Of our 460 participants, 54.6% identified as male, 44.6%
        as female, and 0.8% as another gender. 70.9% of
        participants were between 25 and 54 years old, 8.0% were
        younger, and 20.8% older. Only 11.5% of participants were
        classified as having technical expertise due to having held
        degrees or jobs in computer science, IT, or related fields.
        Nearly all participants used Chrome for desktop browsing on
        a regular basis (96.7%), although many additionally used
        Firefox (64.3%), and to a lesser extent, Edge/Internet
        Explorer (21.1%) and Safari (14.3%). Chrome was also the
        most popular for mobile browsing (73.7%), although Safari
        (33.0%) was used more than Firefox (12.6%) and
        Edge/Internet Explorer (2.2%).</p>
        <p>While 80.4% of participants use private browsing at
        least some of the time for desktop browsers, participants
        more frequently used standard mode. Across browsers,
        participants reported using private mode for 15% (median)
        of their browsing. In stark contrast, only 19.1% of
        participants used private browsing on mobile devices.</p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">4.2</span> Reasons for
            Using Private Browsing Mode</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>For participants who reported using private mode in
        their own browsing, we asked a free-response question about
        why they did so. The top six reasons participants provided
        were to: 1) hide browsing history, especially visits to
        adult websites; 2) prevent targeted ads and search
        suggestions; 3) achieve ”safer” browsing; 4) prevent
        browsers from saving login-related information; 5) avoid
        cookies; 6) accommodate intentional or unintentional use by
        others. Our observations of points 1, 4, and 5 echo Gao et
        al.’s findings&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. In addition, we observed a new
        reason — preventing targeted ads and search suggestions —
        that 15.1% of participants mentioned for desktop browsing
        and 15.6% mentioned for mobile.</p>
        <p>Although all six reasons largely align with the intended
        characteristics of private browsing, careful reading of the
        third point's free text revealed a plurality of definitions
        of ”safer” browsing. For example, P221 simply noted, “I
        feel a little more secure,” while P448 reported, “If I'm
        going to a site that may be questionable, I use the private
        mode to protect myself.” Some participants also mentioned
        tracking in a vague sense, such as “I like not being able
        to be stalked by people when I'm surfing the web” (P148).
        We further analyze related misconceptions in
        Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-19">4.5</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, some reasons for using private mode were tied
        to a sense of device ownership. Overall, 27 participants
        considered a desktop or mobile device's shared nature in
        choosing to use private mode, for example, “[s]o that
        others in my household don't see the sites I visited”
        (P123). Another 47 participants considered unforeseen
        “users,” such as thieves, finders of a lost device, or
        friendly borrowers.</p>

        <p>Our first goal was to understand at a high level the
        degree to which the disclosure the participant saw impacted
        their understanding of private mode. To do so, we created
        two indices per participant:</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list16" label="•">
            <strong>Correctness score</strong>: How many scenarios
            the participants answered correctly, summed across the
            comparative scenarios and responses for private mode in
            distinguishing scenarios. This index excludes six
            scenarios where the correct answer depended on the
            browser used or browsing context, as detailed in
            Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-12">3.4</a>.
            Higher values indicate a larger number of scenarios
            answered correctly.<br />
          </li>
          <li id="list17" label="•"><strong>Confidence
          score</strong>: The sum of the confidence ratings (each
          on a 0–3 scale) participants gave for the same fourteen
          scenarios. Higher values indicate greater
          confidence.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We then created linear regression models for these two
        indices. For both models, we used the following six
        independent variables, representing the study-specific and
        demographic features we hypothesized might be correlated
        with correctness or confidence:</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list18" label="•">Condition; categorical with
          control as the baseline<br /></li>
          <li id="list19" label="•">Participant's gender;
          categorical with female as the baseline<br /></li>
          <li id="list20" label="•">Whether the participant had
          technical expertise; categorical with “no” as the
          baseline<br /></li>
          <li id="list21" label="•">Participant's age range;
          ordinal with 18-24 as the baseline<br /></li>
          <li id="list22" label="•">The percent of time, averaged
          across browsers used, that the participant browses in
          private mode; continuous (0–100)<br /></li>
          <li id="list23" label="•">The number of times the
          participant reopened the disclosure during the study;
          continuous (0–5, the maximum observed)<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of the thirteen disclosures we tested, twelve are
        currently deployed in browsers. Surprisingly, we found that
        most of these disclosures did not significantly impact
        participants’ understanding of what private browsing mode
        does and does not do compared to our meaninglessly vague
        control condition. For only two of these twelve disclosures
        did the correctness score differ significantly from the
        control disclosure. As shown in Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl"
        href="#tab2">2</a>, participants who saw the disclosures
        Google Chrome either currently uses (Chrome condition) or
        previously used (Chrome-Old) for desktop browsers answered
        more scenarios correctly than those who saw the control
        disclosure (<em>p</em> = .032 and <em>p</em> = .028,
        respectively). Of the fourteen scenarios whose answers did
        not depend on the browser or browsing context, participants
        in the control condition answered 10.4 correctly on
        average. In contrast, Chrome and Chrome-Old participants
        answered 11.1 and 11.3 questions correctly on average. Two
        other disclosures (Firefox and Safari-Mobile) seemed to
        positively impact correctness scores. While the p-values
        for these disclosures were not below our <em>α</em> = .05
        threshold, they were marginally significant (.05 &lt; p
        &lt; .10) and therefore may warrant further
        investigation.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, three of the mobile disclosures appeared
        less successful than the meaninglessly vague control at
        informing participants about private browsing mode.
        Compared to the control (10.4 average correctness score),
        participants who saw Brave-Mobile (10.1), Firefox-Mobile
        (9.9), or Opera-Mobile (9.9) had lower correctness scores
        on average, though these differences were not statistically
        significant. Among demographic factors, we found that only
        gender was significantly correlated with the correctness
        score. Participants who identified as male had higher
        correctness scores than those who identified as female
        (<em>p</em> = .013)</p>
        <p>As shown in Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
        "#tab3">3</a>, which disclosure participants saw mostly did
        not impact their self-reported confidence in their answers.
        Relative to the control, only participants who saw
        Chrome-Old (<em>p</em> = .031) or Firefox (<em>p</em> =
        .043) were significantly more confident in their answers.
        Participants who identified as male were more confident in
        their answers than those who identified as female
        (<em>p</em> &lt; .001), while younger participants were
        more confident in their answers than older participants
        (<em>p</em> &lt; .001). Surprisingly, participants who
        spent more time browsing in private mode in their own
        browsing were less confident in their answers (<em>p</em> =
        .010), which we hypothesize may have been due to
        experiencing events that challenged their assumptions about
        private mode.</p>

        <p>We denoted scenarios where over 20% of participants
        (across disclosures) answered the question about private
        mode incorrectly as exhibiting misconceptions. As shown in
        Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab4">4</a>, there were
        three scenarios for which nearly all participants answered
        the question about private mode correctly (i.e., were
        non-misconceptions). Overall, 97.2% of participants
        correctly realized that files downloaded in private mode
        would remain on the computer after the browsing session was
        closed, as in standard mode. All but 1.1% of participants
        knew that their browsing history was saved in the history
        menu in standard mode, and all but 5.2% of participants
        knew that it would not be saved in the history menu in
        private mode. Similarly, whereas all but 9.6% of
        participants knew that, in standard mode, photos viewed in
        the browser would be cached for quicker loading in future
        sessions, all but 10.2% of participants knew that this
        caching would not occur in private mode.</p>

        <p>Despite focusing participants’ attention on the
        disclosure, we still observed misconceptions that cover the
        spectrum of previously documented misconceptions. We
        differentiate between misconceptions that overestimate and
        underestimate private mode.</p>
        <section id="sec-20">
          <p><em>4.5.1 Overestimating Private Mode's
          Protections.</em> Participants had a number of
          misconceptions in which they overestimated what private
          mode would do. A surprising 56.3% of participants
          believed that even while a user was logged into a Google
          account, their search queries would not be saved while in
          private mode. The large majority of participants (144)
          believed this to be the case because private mode does
          not save search histories, conflating the browser's local
          history with Google's. Further, 77 participants believed
          that private mode would remove logged info
          retroactively.</p>
          <p>Some participants (46.5%) believed bookmarks saved in
          private mode would not persist in later sessions. For
          example, 54 participants believed that private mode
          deletes all local, temporary data, including bookmarks.
          Due to a typo in the survey instrument, the data we
          report includes a fraction of users (around 25%,
          according to qualitative responses) who understood the
          typo to imply that we were asking about a different
          browser. Nonetheless, we still label this scenario a
          misconception because of participants who believed
          bookmarks would be deleted when closing private mode.</p>
          <p>In addition, 40.2% of participants thought websites
          would not be able to estimate a user's location. Most
          (125 participants) believed location hiding was simply a
          feature of private browsing, but a further 21
          participants specified geolocation would be impossible
          because IP addresses, used to estimate location, were
          hidden.</p>
          <p>Nearly all participants correctly realized that their
          browsing could be tracked by their ISP, employer (when on
          their network), and the government while in standard
          mode. However, 22.0%, 37.0%, and 22.6% of participants
          mistakenly believed that ISPs, employers, and the
          government would be unable to track them when they used
          private mode.<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id=
          "foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> Most commonly, participants
          simply believed that no search history would be saved, so
          outside entities would not have access. Other reasons
          included mistaken expectations that IP addresses would be
          hidden, cookies could no longer be used, and that private
          mode automatically included VPN functionality.
          Interestingly, 10 participants believed the government
          would need a warrant to access browsing activity from
          private mode.</p>
          <p>Overall, 27.1% of participants believed private mode
          offered more protection against viruses and malware than
          standard, primarily attributing this to private mode not
          saving information, especially cookies and ads, locally.
          For example, P146 declared, “it's a no brainer really,
          when in private mode nothing is stored,” while P67 added,
          “when you are in private mode there is no direct link to
          you or your computer so malware etc. would not be saved
          onto your computer or in your cookies.” Other
          participants simply believed, without specifics, that
          private mode was more secure, “because private mode
          sounds and usually is more secure when visiting websites,
          I would think it would be much safer to visit them”
          (P197).</p>
          <p>Additionally, 25.2% believed sites a user visited in
          private mode would be unable to see the user's IP
          address. Most (89 participants) believed that this was a
          feature of private browsing, similar to geolocation. P151
          noted, “private modes...block your outgoing information,
          this includes IP.” Some (10) confused private mode with
          VPNs: “Private mode usually masks the IP address by using
          the VPN style option that would generate a different IP
          address” (P72).</p>

          <p>The disclosure significantly impacted participants’
          responses about tracking by ISPs, employers, and
          governments (FET, <em>p</em> = .005, <em>p</em> &lt;
          .001, <em>p</em> = .014, respectively). Supporting RQ2,
          Firefox-Mobile performed significantly worse than Firefox
          in all three scenarios (FET, <em>p</em> = .009,
          <em>p</em> = .020, <em>p</em> = .002). Whereas only 5.9%,
          17.1%, and 8.6% of Firefox participants mistakenly
          believed private mode would prevent tracking, 37.1%,
          45.7%, and 42.9% of Firefox-Mobile participants had such
          a misconception, respectively. In Section&nbsp;<a class=
          "sec" href="#sec-23">5</a>, we discuss how Firefox's
          “tracking protection” feature appears to impact this
          misconception. For tracking by ISPs and employers, we
          similarly found a higher rate of misconceptions for
          Brave-Mobile compared to Brave (FET, <em>p</em> = .003
          and <em>p</em> = .002). While 5.4% and 13.5% of Brave
          participants expected private mode to prevent tracking by
          ISPs and employers, 33.3% and 50.0% of Brave-Mobile
          participants expected the same. We also observed some
          evidence in support for RQ1. Whereas 13.5% of Brave
          participants expected private mode would prevent tracking
          by employers, 40.5% of control participants had this
          misconception (FET, <em>p</em> = .018).</p>

        <section id="sec-21">
          <p><em>4.5.2 Underestimating Private Mode's
          Protections.</em> In three scenarios, however,
          participants underestimated private mode's protections.
          As shown in Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab5">5</a>,
          over half of participants believed the names of files
          downloaded in private mode would appear in the list of
          downloaded files, when the opposite is true for all
          browsers except for Brave. The common explanations for
          this misconception were closely related: private mode
          does not prevent files from being downloaded (93
          participants) and, if downloads are saved, the file would
          still be available (86 participants). This misconception
          seems to stem in part from participants’ confusion
          between the browser's list of recently downloaded files
          and the files themselves. Nonetheless, we observed
          significant differences across conditions (<em>χ</em>
          <sup>2</sup>(12) = 38.1, <em>p</em> = .001). In the
          control condition, 32.4% of participants mistakenly
          believed downloaded files would still be listed in the
          browser. A higher proportion of participants in Brave
          (62.2%, <em>χ</em> <sup>2</sup>(1) = 5.4, <em>p</em> =
          .020) and Firefox (77.1%, <em>χ</em> <sup>2</sup>(1) =
          12.7, <em>p</em> &lt; .001) held this misconception.
          Notably, both the Brave and Firefox disclosures mention
          downloaded files.</p>
          <p>As private mode deletes cookies across sessions, one
          should expect to see fewer targeted ads in private mode
          over time. Many participants were unaware of this; 27.2%
          believed the proportion of advertisements that would be
          targeted based on a user's search history would be the
          same across modes. Most of these participants (70)
          believed ads were irrelevant to the “privacy” of private
          mode. They did not fully appreciate that private mode
          would make third-party tracking more difficult, though
          not impossible&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
          data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. Expectations about targeting
          differed by condition (KW, <em>H</em>(12) = 30.5,
          <em>p</em> = .009). Surprisingly, a higher proportion of
          participants who saw the control disclosure were correct
          than those who saw Brave (MW, <em>U</em> = 399,
          <em>p</em> &lt; .001), Chrome (MW, <em>U</em> = 465,
          <em>p</em> = 0.010), or Edge (MW, <em>U</em> = 387,
          <em>p</em> = 0.004). Furthermore, Brave-Mobile
          participants were more correct than Brave (MW, <em>U</em>
          = 464.5, <em>p</em> = 0.019).</p>
          <p>In contrast to search queries when logged into a
          Google account, which can be associated trivially,
          associating search queries across sessions in private
          mode is more difficult, albeit not
          impossible&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
          data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. While debatable, we chose to
          consider the 30.0% of participants who believed such
          searches could be associated across sessions as
          misconceptions based on their explanations. For example,
          47 participants simply expected that Google would be able
          to know. In P326’s words, “Google.com is the worst for
          snooping on every single individual in the world. Nothing
          escapes their tentacles.”</p>

        <p>In the final six scenarios, the impact of private mode
        depends on either the browser used or the browsing context.
        While there is not a clear correct answer for these
        scenarios, we nonetheless included them to document
        participants’ perceptions and expectations.</p>
        <p>Browsers differ in handling browser extensions, which
        can associate sessions and respawn identifiers if active in
        private mode&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>]. Extensions are always enabled in
        Firefox&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>] and Safari&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>], yet always disabled in
        Edge. In both Chrome and Opera, extensions are disabled by
        default in private mode, but can be enabled. Similarly,
        site-specific preferences (e.g., pop-ups) are not saved in
        private mode by Chrome&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>] and Edge, but are saved by Firefox
        and Opera.</p>
        <p>While nearly all participants expected browser
        extensions to be active and site-specific preferences to
        persist in standard mode, expectations for private mode
        were mixed (Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab6">6</a>).
        This is notable because these behaviors are subtle vectors
        for privacy leaks. In private mode, 69.1% of participants
        expected extensions to be active and 31.3% expected
        preferences to be saved. Although browsers differ in actual
        behavior, responses did not differ by disclosure.</p>
        <p>While private modes eliminate much of the browsing data
        stored locally, implementations are
        imperfect&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0047">47</a>]. Nevertheless, 47.2% of
        participants thought a forensics expert could not determine
        a user's private browsing history even with physical
        access.</p>
        <p>Whereas Brave blocks ads&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] and Firefox blocks only
        ads that track users&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>], other browsers do not block ads
        in private mode. Despite these actual differences,
        responses did not differ by condition; 32.2% of
        participants expected more ads in standard mode than
        private mode, while 64.9% expected no difference
        (Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab7">7</a>). 100
        participants believed standard mode's saving of history
        would facilitate ads, while 37 participants believed
        standard mode would have more ads because they thought
        there would be no cookies in private mode: “This has to do
        with cookies...If they can't see anything then they have no
        idea what ads to show” (P82).</p>
        <p>Because private browsing mode creates a new cookie store
        per session, less data may be transferred in web requests,
        leading to faster page loads. In contrast, because less
        information is cached, page loads might also be slower.
        Among participants, 21.6% expected pages to load faster in
        private mode as fewer “extras” would weigh browsing down.
        In contrast, 24.8% expected pages to load faster in
        standard mode, mostly explaining that private mode would
        lack cached data. However, a few expected private mode to
        be slowed by security features. P241 wrote, “Private mode
        has to put the websites into more secure protocols prior to
        displaying them.”</p>
        <p>Finally, for cookie-based shopping carts, items placed
        in the cart in private mode would not remain in the cart if
        the site were opened in standard mode. For carts associated
        with a user who has logged into an account, private mode
        likely would not make a difference. Based on our
        qualitative analysis, this difference in mental models
        appears to explain why 21.2% of participants expected items
        added to a cart in private mode would persist in standard
        mode.</p>

      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>], our study is the first
      to examine how browsers’ disclosures impact these
      misconceptions. We conducted a user study in which 460
      participants saw one of 13 disclosures and answered questions
      about 20 different browsing scenarios. In most browsers,
      disclosures about private mode take up the full page each
      time a new private window is opened. The content of these
      disclosures differs substantially across browsers, as well as
      between a given browser's desktop and mobile versions. Users
      might also learn about private browsing from friends, online
      articles, or blog posts. Nonetheless, effective disclosures
      are vendors’ most reliable channel to communicate features to
      users.</p>
      <p>Of the thirteen disclosures we tested, only the current
      and old versions of Chrome's desktop disclosure led to
      significantly more correct answers than our meaninglessly
      vague control condition. Chrome's successes may be a result
      of their disclosures anticipating misconceptions that users
      have about private mode, and explaining the contrary: for
      example, that it does not hide browsing activity from
      employers or ISPs. Other disclosures only explain
      capabilities, such as deleting local history, or are longer
      in text length. The difference between Chrome's disclosures
      and others, however, amounted to only one additional scenario
      answered correctly. For all disclosures, participants
      maintained important misconceptions about private mode even
      though the study focused on disclosures, in many ways a
      best-case scenario for privacy notices.</p>
      <p>The term “private” is heavily overloaded&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0040">40</a>], and our
      results suggest the name “private mode” implies unintended
      meanings. When disclosures claim users can “browse privately”
      (Chrome), users may refer back to their broader
      conceptualization of privacy. For example, P300 explained
      that “[collecting] the IP address would defeat the purpose of
      privacy if the site could see that even in private mode,”
      while P133 deduced that because tracking “would be a
      violation of privacy,” ISPs could not collect browsing
      history. As such, browsers’ disclosures have the herculean
      task of correcting misconceptions users derive from the name
      “private mode.”</p>
      <p>The disclosures fail at this task. We found that
      participants were able to answer correctly about three
      scenarios where private mode's effects would be apparent
      locally. In contrast, many over-estimations of private mode's
      protections reflect more opaque behaviors. In a scenario
      about searches being tracking while logged into a Google
      account, P232 wrote about how she actually tried to test her
      theory that private mode would prevent Google from
      remembering her search. When the search did not subsequently
      autocomplete, she validated her theory. However, Google
      likely still recorded that search. Even without being logged
      into an account, users can be tracked through browser
      fingerprinting, and experiments to detect how private mode
      actually impacts tracking over the network and by websites
      visited&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] are far beyond the capabilities of
      end-users. This is the role of privacy disclosures.</p>
      <p>Some elements of disclosures were especially problematic.
      Firefox-Mobile highlights its “tracking protection” feature
      (for third-party tracking) without further explaining what
      “tracking protection” is. Notably, many Firefox-Mobile
      participants mistakenly believed they would be protected from
      network-level tracking. More generally, disclosures should
      avoid vague phrases implying private mode will have a broad
      or comprehensive impact. Poor-performing disclosures all
      contained such phrases. Opera-Mobile states “your secrets are
      safe,” while Brave notes “tabs and their cookies vanish.”</p>
      <p>Disclosures appear to be getting worse, not better.
      Firefox Focus recently introduced a disclosure that
      ill-advisedly encourages users to “browse like no one's
      watching.” The poor performance of disclosures in our study
      suggests future work consider personal
      examples&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>], different

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>], and even changing the name of the
      mode to better convey private mode's actual protections.</p>
