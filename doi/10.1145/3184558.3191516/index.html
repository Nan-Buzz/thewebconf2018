        <p><small>As smart cities infrastructures mature, data
        becomes a valuable asset which can radically improve city
        services and tools. Registration, acquisition and
        utilization of data, which will be transformed into smart
        services, are becoming more necessary than ever. Online
        social networks with their enormous momentum are one of the
        main sources of urban data offering heterogeneous real-time
        data at a minimal cost. However, various types of attacks
        often appear on them, which risk users' privacy and affect
        their online trust. The purpose of this article is to
        investigate how risks on online social networks affect
        smart cities and study the differences between privacy and
        security threats with regard to smart people and smart
        living dimensions.</small></p>

          INTRODUCTION</h2>

      </header>
      <p>In recent years, more and more big cities, due to their
      fragility and the demographic, environmental, economic and
      financial pressures are taking [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib1">1</a>], are striving to acquire the profile of
      so-called <em>smart city</em> and provide smart services to
      their stakeholders (e.g., citizens, visitors, investors,
      etc.) [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#bib2">2</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib3">3</a>]. The vision of smart
      cities (SC), appeared in literature in late 1990s, is a
      multidisciplinary topic of research since attracts scientists
      from different research fields (engineering, data science,
      human science, economics), industries driven from information
      and communication technologies (ICT) (e.g., CISCO<a class=
      "fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, IBM<a class=
      "fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>,
      Libelium<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
      "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> ), governments and policy makers
      (e.g., EU smart cities initiative<a class="fn" href="#fn4"
      id="foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a>, Smart City Business
      Institute<a class="fn" href="#fn5" id=
      "foot-fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> ), who are cooperating to
      co-create the cities of tomorrow [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib4">4</a>].</p>
      <p>SC behave as “living organisms” that evolve over time, and
      constantly produce and consume heterogeneous data [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib5">5</a>]. A huge variety of
      fixed or moving devices (e.g. sensors, cameras, meters,
      actuators, RFIDs), the so-called Internet of Things (IoT),
      and applications (e.g., online social networks (OSN), web
      platforms, mobile applications, etc.) act as data sources,
      which record every aspect of city life and produce
      large-scale heterogeneous data [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib4">4</a>]. The penetration of smartphones has
      facilitated the rapid spread and increase the use of OSN, the
      users of which are estimated to have reached 2.46 billion in
      2017 [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#bib6">6</a>]. The
      existence of interconnected objects and the exploitation of
      OSN content result in real-time production of a significantly
      huge volume of urban data offering limitless opportunities
      for acquiring profound knowledge of cities and
      decision-making [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib4">4</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib7">7</a>]. In contrast, the excessive zeal and effort to
      record and monitor any activity within cities raise multiple
      concerns about the security and privacy of citizens
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib8">8</a>]. Critics argue that
      the implementation of SC will have negative implications on
      individuals' freedom and privacy as they trade the
      convenience offered by smart services with the provision of
      sensitive and personal information [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib9">9</a>].</p>
      <p>Since civic engagement in the formulation of SC is vital,
      several researchers addressed the issue of investigating and
      ensuring privacy and security in the SC context in order to
      reduce individuals’ concerns and suspicion, and empower their
      participation in social life and cities’ efficient operation
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib15">15</a>], [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib33">33</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib34">34</a>]. The majority of them focused on
      investigating and addressing cyber-security and
      privacy-related issues related to ICT infrastructures (e.g.,
      IoT, networks, databases, etc.) and SC applications
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib8">8</a>], [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib10">10</a>-<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib15">15</a>]. Specifically, Bartoli et al. [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib10">10</a>], summarizing the
      privacy key issues and emerging technology standards,
      highlighted the need to impose high security requirements on
      IoT technologies used in SC to avoid third-party abuse, and
      the dissociation between urban and personal data.
      Furthermore, Beltran et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib11">11</a>] have developed the IoT-Architecture
      Reference Model (IoT-ARM) and its app to empower citizens to
      use their IoT and feel secure that their privacy is
      protected. A two-level privacy architecture was also proposed
      by Mazhelis et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib13">13</a>] aiming at protecting the sensitive personal
      information that citizens disclosure when using various smart
      applications, while Solomon et al. [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib14">14</a>] conducted a comparative
      assessment of three encrypted-based techniques regarding to
      smartphone applications that offer close proximity detection
      preventing any location information leak.</p>
      <p>Beyond the risks threaten infrastructure and applications,
      major privacy and security concerns arise from the underlying
      risks on OSN. OSN, which are inexpensive tools for data
      collection and pattern extraction in SC, suffer from various
      threats and attacks [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib23">23</a>] that endanger their users and affect their
      usefulness and credibility. Unlike the IoT and smart
      applications, the privacy and security issues arising from
      their use in SC have not been adequately discussed. Balleste
      et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#bib12">12</a>]
      attempted to define citizens’ privacy by proposing the “5D
      privacy model in SC”, which concerns all urban data sources
      used in SC. Of particular interest is also the “2x2 privacy
      protection framework” proposed by Zoonen, [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib15">15</a>] which involves, among others
      (e.g. IoT, apps, etc.), privacy concerns on OSN, aiming to
      help policymakers understand and review issues related to the
      protection of privacy in SC.</p>
      <p>Considering OSN as a valuable data source for gaining
      insight into cities, this article aims to shed light on
      privacy and security issues related to the OSN use in SC.
      Exploiting the existing literature, the borderlines between
      privacy, which depends on individual's perception and
      attitude, and security, which reflects the quality of life in
      cities, are set, and their interaction is investigated.
      Initially, the usefulness of OSN in SC is highlighted, and
      the potential privacy and security risks appeared on them are
      presented. Particular emphasis is placed on threats targeted
      at children since are a sensitive age group of smart people,
      which will play a significant role in the future of SC. Then,
      smart people and smart living dimensions are analyzed and
      their interaction regarding privacy and security issues on
      OSN is discussed. Finally, a novel relationship model which
      specifies the relationships between privacy and security
      threats, along with some useful tools to protect and enhance
      social networking, is proposed, aiming to address the
      challenges of privacy and security of OSN in SC.</p>
      <p>The contribution of this study is twofold: i) deals with
      the impact of OSN privacy and security risks on the social
      dimensions of SC (i.e., smart people and smart living) and
      attempts to investigate their interaction, and ii) introduces
      the issue of children' privacy and security protection in SC.
      Furthermore, the proposed relationship model of security and
      privacy threats, can be a useful tool for stakeholders who
      utilize OSN as urban data source and care about individuals’
      security and engagement in SC.</p>
      <p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section
      <a class="sec" href="#sec2">2</a> deals with OSN as a source
      of urban data which are exposed to potential privacy and
      security risks. Section <a class="sec" href="#sec3">3</a>
      identifies the main characteristics of smart people and smart
      living dimensions and discusses their interaction on privacy
      and security issues on OSN. Section <a class="sec" href=
      "#sec4">4</a> proposes the relationship model of privacy and
      security threats and suggests some useful tools to protect
      and encourage the participation of people on OSN. Finally,
      Section <a class="sec" href="#sec5">5</a> contains some
      conclusions and future perspectives.</p>

      <p>The proliferation of OSN, which are used mainly as means
      of interactive communication among individuals, offers new
      possibilities for recording and analyzing data about human
      activities and the cities in which they live. However, OSN,
      sometimes, because of their misuse, prove dangerous for the
      privacy and security of individuals and cities, respectively.
      The opportunities and threats that arise from their use are
      analyzed in the following subsections.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>OSN (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Instagram,
        etc.) acting as “human sensors”, compared to IoT, offer
        volumes of heterogeneous data, reduced costs,
        interoperability, and dependability [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib16">16</a>]. Examining the impact of OSN on
        e-government and e-participation, Dameri and Ricciardi
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib17">17</a>], concluded that
        OSN can make a significant contribution to: i) service
        delivery, ii) governance participation, and iii) smartness
        awareness. Doran et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib16">16</a>], using geo-located data from Twitter, have
        recognized and visualized various geographic, social,
        cultural and political characteristics that have led to the
        extraction of citizens' perceptual patterns in a large
        city, while Kumar &amp; Ahmed [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib18">18</a>] exploited Twitter for traffic event
        detection. OSN, due to their advantages, have already been
        widely utilized for the implementation of SC either
        independently or complementary to the IoT and their use is
        expected to increase in the future [<a class="bib"

        </header>
        <p>Despite the fact that OSN is a useful tool for
        stakeholders (e.g., local authorities, companies, etc.)
        that exploit the data produced, many privacy and security
        concerns arise. Individuals increasingly register and share
        personal information (such as date of birth, email address,
        telephone number, home address, photos, videos, etc.) on
        OSN and their content can be used in many ways exposing
        them to danger. In many cases human activity, sentiment and
        opinion of individuals on OSN are recorded and analyzed in
        their absence [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib12">12</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        "#bib20">20</a>].</p>
        <p>For the purpose of investigating the privacy and
        security concerns raised in the SC context, at this point,
        we will clarify the terms of “privacy” and “security”,
        which are often confused. <em>Privacy</em> concerns the
        protection of individual's personal information from the
        illegal disclosure and use by third malicious parties and

        of:</p>
        <ol class="list-no-style">
          <li label="1."><em>Individual's identity anonymity:</em>
          concerns the protection of the user's identity, so that

        <ol class="list-no-style">
          <li label="1."><em>Classic threats:</em> threats that
          occurred when the Internet was created and spread, and
          referred as malware, phishing, spam or cross-site
          scripting attacks. Although these threats have been
          addressed in the past, due to the spread of OSN, they are
          becoming more viral and spreading through their users and
          their friends.<br /></li>
          <li label="2."><em>Modern threats:</em> threats related
          to OSN and target the individuals’ personal information
          and the personal information of their friends.
          Information and location leakage, fake profiles, identity
          clone attacks and face recognition are just some of these

          <li label="4."><em>Threats targeting children:</em>
          threats directed exclusively at children and adolescents.
          Online predators, cyber-bullying and children's risky

        <p>OSN users are also exposed to risks by their share
        multimedia content, many of which are indirect or often
        ignored by the majority of them. The most dangerous from
        these risks are: <em>i) multimedia content, ii) lack of
        policies, iii) platform vulnerabilities and iv) open
        access</em>. The individual's sensitive and personal
        content is stored, daily, as multimedia files on OSN, which
        are software platforms vulnerable to the bugs and malicious
        third parties. Additionally, the lack of policies to govern
        every possible privacy issue or to allow fine-grained user
        customization and the existing “freemium” model, which
        allows individuals to register quite easily, contribute to
        the creation of multiple and false accounts complicating
        the detection of malicious actors [<a class="bib"

        <p>The most peculiar and dangerous threats mentioned above
        are threats targeting children. These threats, which can be
        extended to adults, are usually caused by psychological
        factors and occur both in real life and in online life.
        Online predators and cyber-bullying attacks are booming
        nowadays. Adults or minors in order to satisfy their
        fantasies and to erase their frustration and anger, often,
        sexually harass or intimidate their potential victims
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib23">23</a>]. Parents cannot
        fully protect their children whose critical ability and
        online defense on OSN are minimal, while in many cases
        adults are sharing sensitive personal information and
        photos on OSN regarding to their children, exposing them to
        privacy and security risks [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib24">24</a>]. The&nbsp;Canadian Centre for Child
        Protection<a class="fn" href="#fn6" id=
        "foot-fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> has revealed that children
        under 12 years old were depicted in 78.30% of the images
        and videos assessed by their team. Furthermore, recent
        surveys have revealed that cyber-bullying<a class="fn"
        href="#fn7" id="foot-fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> occurs mainly
        through OSN, while more than 82% of online sex crimes

        originate from OSN that predators use to gain insight into
        their victims. Αs these threats greatly affect children's
        behavior and psychology, they can have disastrous and
        irreversible effects, such as in the cases of Amanda

        are summarized in: i) <em>human factors</em>, which are
        <em>creativity, social learning and education</em>, and ii)
        <em>social factors</em>, such as <em>social ethnic
        plurality, open-mindedness and individuals’ participation
        in public life</em> [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib26">26</a>]. Individuals share their opinions,
        feelings and content on OSN, record data through personal
        IoT (e.g. wearable devices, smart meters in their homes,
        personal health applications etc.), and in some cases
        participate in surveys and crowdsourcing activities (e.g,
        SEN2SOC<a class="fn" href="#fn9" id=

        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib4">4</a>]. Their data is an asset to cities
        as offers knowledge and helps in decision-making.</p>
        <p>With regard to OSN, when individuals combine some or all
        of the aforementioned smart factors and provide, knowingly
        and responsibly, their personal data, taking into account
        all privacy and security threats, can contribute
        significantly to preservation and improvement of security
        in cities. Privacy is primarily personal responsibility, is
        ensured by the proper use of the proposed privacy settings
        and can lead to security protection as individuals cease to
        be vulnerable to malicious parties. Recent studies revealed
        that the only way to enhance the involvement of individuals
        is to feel safe that their personal data recorded by the
        various devices and applications are fully protected and
        that they control the purpose of its use [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib13">13</a>]. Thus, the feeling of security
        and confidence on OSN, will enhance the participation of
        individuals, which in collaboration with their fellow
        citizens and local authorities will co-create new smart
        services and strengthen social cohesion [<a class="bib"

        "#bib27">27</a>].</p>
        <p>On the contrary, the lack of skills, education and
        awareness of individuals about the safe use of the OSN
        leads them to naivety, carelessness and loss of control
        making them vulnerable to the underlying privacy and
        security risks [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

        opportunity to attack and achieve their goals, degrading
        security on OSN and causing concerns and fears for their
        users. Concerns about the leakage of privacy and the
        purpose of using data collected by third parties discourage
        the individuals’ involvement on OSN and social life,
        leading to the registration of inaccurate and false data

        interaction and correlation between the individuals’
        privacy perception and the public perception of security in
        cities, which affect significantly smart people and smart

        level can drive to global security level in cities and
        vice-versa, as depicted in Fig <a class="fig" href=

        factors on individuals determines their behavior and
        attitudes towards data provision and privacy issues and has
        a positive or negative impact on security in cities.
        Specifically, as shown in <a class="fig" href="#fig2">Fig.

        Additionally, social networking data is transformed into
        valuable knowledge for cities, leading to the development
        of new services and the enhancement of smart living.

        "#fig3">Fig. 3</a>). As demonstrated in <a class="fig"
        href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>, individuals’ privacy on OSN is
        threatened by risks associated with their identity, profile
        content, and communication network information [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib21">21</a>]. Moreover, risks
        that threaten children's privacy, which are a special case,
        have been also added. The security threats [<a class="bib"

        degrade the life quality in cities, were analyzed and their
        relations with the aforementioned privacy threats were
        defined. The proposed relationship model of privacy and
        security threats is based on the analysis of the security
        attacks, presented by Fire et al. [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

        <p>The proposed model that specifies the relationships
        between the potential privacy and security threats on OSN
        can be a useful tool for stakeholders who utilize OSN as
        urban data source and care about individuals’ security and
        engagement in SC. For instance, they can develop novel
        smart and specialized tools and applications to protect or
        educate individuals and children on OSN, contributing to
        both smart people (e.g., education, awareness, engagement
        etc.) and smart living (e.g., privacy and security
        protection etc.).</p>

        <p>Dealing with privacy and security threats depends mainly
        on individuals’ personal background (e.g., maturity,

        in particular children, to ICT and OSN, the lack of
        adequate and revised legislation and the failure of OSN to
        protect effectively their users, increase the privacy and
        security risks and attacks in cities [<a class="bib"

          CONCLUSIONS</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>This article investigates the security and privacy issues
      of OSN in the SC context. The analysis has demonstrated that
      there is a strong interaction and correlation between
      individual's privacy perception and public perception of
      security. Privacy protection at individual privacy level
      (smart people) can drive to global security level (smart
      living), and vice–versa. The differences between privacy and
      security threats were studied and their borderlines were
      defined. The proposed relationship model of privacy and
      security threats, can enable stakeholders to understand the
      needs in the use of OSN and develop the appropriate tools for
      enhancing the privacy and security in smart cities.</p>
      <p>Education and cultivation of prudent and safe behavior on
      the Internet and OSN combined with the methods and tools
      developed to protect against privacy and security risks on
      OSN can make a decisive contribution to shaping smart people
      and enhancing the quality of life. Active citizens,
      interested in the cities they live in, will be able to use
      properly the OSN to offer valuable urban information without
      worrying about their online security. With regard to smart
      living, the benefit will be twofold as citizens' privacy and
      security will be enhanced and the exploitation of data
      derived from OSN will lead to the improvement and development
      of new smart services.</p>
      <p>In the future, we plan to expand our work by studying
      smart peoples' behavior when dealing with privacy threats and
      security risks on OSN, with the aim of identifying and
      addressing vulnerabilities in order to enhance their
      significant involvement in SC through social networking.</p>
