Also, many online streaming services, such as YouTube&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0055">55</a>], Facebook Live&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>], Twitter&#x0027;s Periscope&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>], and Twitch&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0046">46</a>], have also become popular.</p>    <p>Such VoIP applications or streaming services, however, may raise privacy concerns. As for VoIP applications, some users, e.g., those engaged in secretive meetings, anonymous reporting or those doing a secret chat in general, have to not only anonymize their identities but also their locations even when they do not perceive the location privacy threat because they are not intentionally sharing their locations. Several previous studies&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] demonstrated that location information can reveal sensitive information about users. Therefore, some services already tried to anonymize or obfuscate a user&#x0027;s actual location. For example, Skype, which is one of the most widely used VoIP applications, recently updated its default application settings to use a proxy server to hide users&#x2019; IP addresses&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>].</p>    <p>Location privacy issues are also prevalent in streaming services. The safety of those broadcasting and hosting live shows at homes may be threatened because stalkers or potentially inappropriate fans could locate their victims, and make physical visits to the victims&#x2019; private places. Hence, most streaming services might conceal not only content creators&#x2019; (or broadcasters&#x2019;) IP addresses but also any other location-related information about them. Popular streaming services like Twitch already use an anonymity policy to hide users&#x2019; network addresses for their privacy&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0047">47</a>].</p>    <p>However, researchers have presented various ways of compromising location privacy. PowerSpy&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>], for instance, is a technique that can infer a mobile phone&#x0027;s location with the only measurement of the aggregate power consumption of the phone. Furthermore, in another study on Android mobile phone&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0039">39</a>], it can also be inferred only by using sensors like gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer without requiring any permission.</p>    <p>In this paper, we propose a novel side-channel attack for compromising user location based on a &#x201C;<em>Location Inference using SignaTures generated from Electric Network frequencies</em>&#x201D; (LISTEN) technique. Unlike previous work&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0039">39</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>] that requires the installation of a specific malicious application on a victim&#x0027;s device, the LISTEN attack can be performed with popular VoIP applications or online streaming services that are already being used. In fact, the only piece needed to perform the attack is a target multimedia file.</p>    <p>To implement the LISTEN attack, an attacker collects electrical network frequency (ENF) signals transmitted from a victim&#x0027;s device via her microphone, and analyzes them to infer the victim&#x0027;s location. ENF is the supply frequency of electrical power in electricity distribution networks. In general, the ENF signals are mostly captured in a particular frequency, either 50Hz or 60Hz. Moreover, the patterns of fluctuations of ENF signals are very similar at time and space because those patterns are highly influenced by the difference between power supply and demand in the same power grid&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>]. Since the fluctuations have spatial and temporal characteristics, they can be used as signatures to identify the victim&#x0027;s temporal location&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0040">40</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0043">43</a>].</p>    <p>The location identification techniques using the ENF signals have been intensively studied for several years. These researches allow us to figure out which power grid the ENF signals extracted from&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>], and also obtain the precise location information within the grid&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]. However, the existing ENF processing techniques&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>] are not sufficient to implement the LISTEN attack. In general, they failed to infer geographical location information about a victim&#x0027;s place in real-time. Furthermore, it was not clear how the ENF signals should be well extracted from audio and/or video streaming data used in VoIP applications or streaming services, which is necessary for performing the LISTEN attack in a practical setting.</p>    <p>In our work, we present a novel approach which can handle these matters. We summarize our contributions as follows.</p>    <ul class="list-no-style">    <li id="list1" label="&#x2022;">We proposed a novel location privacy attack to infer a victim&#x0027;s location with the ENF signals extracted from the multimedia streaming data transmitted for VoIP applications or online streaming services. Our ENF signal collection method is much cheaper than existing approaches&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0052">52</a>] since we merely collect audio signals from online streaming services that contain the location information for the recorded multimedia streaming data without using any expensive hardware. Also, our attack does not assume any additional malicious application being installed on a victim&#x0027;s device besides VoIP applications or client applications for the target online streaming service.<br/></li>    <li id="list2" label="&#x2022;">We evaluated the performance of the proposed attack in real-world environments. Both theoretical parameters and realistic environments for audio channels were used in the evaluation, showing that our approach provides an accuracy of 90% for inter-grid estimation with 40 minutes long audio, and 76% of intra-grid estimation with 5 minutes long audio.<br/></li>    </ul>    <p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section &#x00A0;<a class="sec" href="#sec-8">2</a>, we explain how ENF signals can be obtained from online multimedia stream data and used for location tracking.

ENF signals are generally embedded in a particular frequency by a stabilizer of power supply systems&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>]; either 50Hz or 60Hz frequency is used depending on geographic location. Europe and China use 50Hz for AC current, whereas the United States and Canada use 60Hz. In the real world, however, small fluctuations of ENF signals exist &#x2013; this is because of the differences that exist between power being supplied and the demand for power at a given moment&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>]. Such small variations that exist in ENF signals have been exploited in many application domains including abnormal event detection&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>], electrical disturbances&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0052">52</a>], and digital forensics &#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>]. To that end, many researchers have tried various ways to obtain accurate ENF signals.</p>    <p>One way to acquire ENF signals is to use specialized physical electrical devices such as a frequency disturbance recorder (FDR), which is a type of phasor measurement unit used in smart grids&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0056">56</a>]. ENF signals can also be obtained from multimedia data such as audio and video files&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0044">44</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0052">52</a>] such as Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>. This figure demonstrates the spectrogram of an audio file that was recorded in Europe. This spectrogram is obtained using a short time frequency transform (STFT) technique to capture non-stationary ENF signals.

However, ENF patterns constructed from side-channels such as audio and video files often have much lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than those directly acquired from an FDR device. Therefore, advanced signal processing techniques are needed to be applied to reduce or remove unwanted noise. The ENF signal extraction process mainly consists of the following four steps.</p>    <section id="sec-11">     <p><em>2.2.1 Decimating and framing.</em> After multimedia data are decimated to 1kHz to save the storage space, we created frames of data sequences, where each frame overlaps with the half of the previous frame. Each frame contains 8192 samples, which comes to about 8 seconds of decimated audio data in each frame. 4096 samples overlap with each other. This concept comes from the STFT technique.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-12">     <p><em>2.2.2 Applying the quadratic interpolated fast Fourier transform (QIFFT) technique.</em> The next step involves applying the QIFFT technique to each frame. It is necessary to improve the resolution of ENF signal estimation when frame sizes are small&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]. This step is designed to find the maximum value of ENF signals from a given frequency of each frame. A band pass filter is applied to truncate unnecessary frequency ranges from a given frequency domain to obtain the maximum value. We then apply the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) technique to each frame, identifying the index of highest frequency value &#x2013; this is done by tracing the maximum value, moving from frame to frame. However, in this case, the maximum (peak) spectra value estimation is less precise than resolution estimation so, we apply the Quadratic Interpolation technique when the FFT process is complete &#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>]. That is, we can search for interpolated peaks on the composed spectra and links them using the QIFFT [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] because the computation of the STFT is too heavy to extract signals quickly from hundreds of multimedia.

The multi-tone harmonics method uses both a fundamental frequency and harmonic frequencies for exploring the peak position from the ENF spectrum. In this multi-tone harmonics method, the maximum-likelihood estimation technique is applied to the harmonic signals, using Cramer-Rao bound for frequency estimation error to show that the estimation accuracy of ENF signals can be improved by about 10 &#x2212; 15<em>&#x03BC;</em>Hz&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>].

In this environment, the attacker&#x0027;s goal is to infer the victim&#x0027;s geographic location by analyzing the received ENF signals. Such environments appear to be often made in many real-world situations.

In following paragraphs, we describe those metrics and the techniques how attackers mitigate those problems.</p>    <section id="sec-20">     <p><em>4.2.1 Frequency response.</em> Audio recorded from the victim&#x0027;s device can be filtered or amplified when it passes through an audio channel. ENF signals cannot be constructed from such an audio file if (for some reason) the victim&#x0027;s ENF signals are deleted. As human audible frequency ranges from 20Hz to 20kHz, many audio codec standards include a band pass filter for better compression and higher quality given a limited data rate&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>]. For example, in the case of Skype, the VoIP application uses its own codec called SILK&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0051">51</a>]. The compression process of SILK uses a high pass filter for which the cut-off frequency is 70Hz&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0051">51</a>]. Since the base frequency of ENF signal is 50 or 60Hz, SILK will filter it. To resolve this, we use the multi-tone estimation&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0045">45</a>] shown in Section&#x00A0;<a class="sec" href="#sec-10">2.2</a>. We use harmonic signals with frequency of either 100Hz for the 1st frequency 50Hz or 120Hz for the 1st frequency 60Hz, or above.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-21">     <p><em>4.2.2 Time delay and delay jitter.</em> Since we compare the victim&#x0027;s ENF signals against the ENF map based on known locations (signatures), we need to know the exact time of ENF signal extraction. Hence, any time delay is integral and needs to be known. If a VoIP uses a signaling protocol that provides the exact time delay information, the recorded time can be obtained easily. However, there might be some cases that the exact time is hard to find. In such cases, we have to estimate the time delay by calculating normalized correlation coefficient of extracted ENF signals from a target node and those from anchor nodes. At the exact temporal alignment, the cross-correlation coefficient will have the highest value. This calculation must be performed approximately every eight seconds before ENF signals are framed. Here, each frame has 8192 samples.</p>     <p>Jitter, which is packet delay variation, is also one of the metrics of quality of audio channels. Jitter occurs when VoIP delay changes frequently: a sender transmits packets at a regular interval but a receiver receives packets irregularly. It is known that audio codecs in VoIPs or streaming services can reduce jitter &#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>]. Since this jitter reduction incurs its own time delay, aligning time against time delay is a only concern.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-22">     <p><em>4.2.3 Packet loss.</em> Packet loss is another important factor since ENF signals cannot be constructed with loss of information. If a service uses a reliable protocol, we can request for a &#x2018;packet resend&#x2019; to a server when packet loss is detected. Otherwise, missing data cannot be restored. In particular, real-time voice chat services often use P2P protocols, which are unreliable channels and do not support packet resend. Let us consider a common case where a victim uses a laptop and Wi-Fi connection for voice chatting. As many streaming or VoIP services use UDP for a real-time service, packet loss can occur if Wi-Fi communication channel is unreliable.</p>     <p>According to the survey conducted in &#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>], packet loss rate for common VoIP users is about 2% or less.

This process consists of two steps: inter-grid estimation and intra-grid estimation. Since it is time consuming and difficult to estimate the exact location from the whole ENF map, we firstly apply inter-grid estimation to select candidate power grids. After choosing a certain power grid, LISTEN attack performs intra-grid estimation which infers the precise location in the selected power grid by matching the ENF map of the power grid and given victim&#x0027;s ENF signal. For more formal definition in a Bayesian framework, we need two random variables, <em>l<sub>A</sub>     </em> for identifying a specific power grid and <em>l<sub>B</sub>     </em> for locating a specific position. While <em>l<sub>A</sub>     </em> is a discrete random variable for <em>l<sub>A</sub>     </em> &#x2208; {1, 2, &#x22C5;&#x22C5;&#x22C5;, <em>G</em>} where <em>G</em> is the number of power grids, <em>l<sub>B</sub>     </em> is a pair of continuous random variables <em>l<sub>B</sub>     </em> = (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are longitude and latitude respectively.

However, this approach is still useful since it can visibly show an inferred location (see Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>). The color map represents the distances between interpolated ENF sequences and the victim&#x0027;s extracted ENF signal sequences.

Due to this peer-to-peer characteristic, Skype automatically (by default) reveals the participants&#x2019; IP addresses to each other. For that reason, people who prefer using Skype anonymously often use location-concealing methods like VPN or Tor. However, since VPN or Tor usually slows down the connection speed, using VoIP over VPN would increase time delay as well. This experiment was designed to test whether ENF signals can be extracted and restored when there are both frequency filter being applied and some time delay.</p>     <p>The other channel we selected is Torfone. Torfone is a VoIP application that uses <em>onion</em> domains&#x00A0;<a class="fn" href="#fn5" id="foot-fn5"><sup>3</sup></a> as IDs, and connects users through Tor networks. Unlike Skype, Torfone offers several voice codec options for users. Torfone supports ADPCM, GSM, Codec2, and other common voice codecs. Among those options, we chose GSM for experiment after considering the popularity of the candidate codecs.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-31">     <p><em>5.1.4 Virtualized audio channels to emulate VoIP client A (Caller) from a remote host.</em> To run experiments reliably, all conditions except the channels that transfer data need to be kept consistent. However, running various channels at the same time would cause unintentional side effects such as increasing packet loss or time delay. In addition, it is difficult to run the experiments again for verification purposes. In such an experimental setup, it would be impossible to regenerate the exact same outside sound again, and there would be a risk of encountering white noises while mimicking the environmental conditions. Hence, this kind of experimental setup seems impractical due to this intractability of reproducing the exact same audio sounds in Skype+VPN and Torfone. <figure id="fig5">       <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186100/images/www2018-109-fig8.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 5"        longdesc=""/>       <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 5:</span>       <span class="figure-title">To emulate VoIP client A (Caller) from a remote host, we first obtained the audio data from streaming servers and inputted the audio file directly to VoIP software.

Considering that microphones and speakers work in a similar way, it is possible to redirect an output of a speaker (sound information) to an input of a microphone. Then the microphone would obtain the same sound input data as it would receive the speaker output without any sound loss and white noise. Thus, the caller would perform two subsequent steps. First he or she would receive audio files from multimedia streaming servers, and redirect those files to a VoIP software. Hence, the actual, final experiment design is as shown in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a>. This final experimental setup is more effective and efficient than simply putting a speaker next to a microphone, and physically replaying audio files. In such a setup, there are two key risks: (1) we cannot guarantee that sounds from a speaker are fully transferred to a microphone without data loss, (2) noise interference would be inevitable. However, with our audio virtualized environment, there is no risk of noises being added nor risk of losing original information since it inherently prevents physical environments to interfere after recording is done. By simple replaying audio files from the voice sending server, we could easily change the channel conditions without altering the sounds being transferred. All our experiments were conducted using the same condition except the VoIP channel. <figure id="fig6">       <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186100/images/www2018-109-fig6.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 6"        longdesc=""/>       <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 6:</span>       <span class="figure-title">FFT results and spectrograms of the captured audio streaming data.

This section presents Skype communication results and Torfone results.</p>    <p>People can typically hear 20Hz to 20,000Hz but this does not mean that every frequency in this range constitutes a human voice. Since there are certain frequency regions that mainly constitute daily-life sounds including human voice, many VoIP software apply special filters in sound data to provide better call quality.</p>    <p>To visualize the effect of the filter in the audio channel, Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a> plots 1D spectrum in the left sub-figures, and 2D spectrograms in the right sub-figures. Top, center, and bottom sub-figures represent (1) <strong>raw audio streams (no distortion)</strong>, (2) <strong>Skype+VPN</strong>, and (3) <strong>Torfone</strong>, respectively. There are two types of transparently coloured regions.

Since Skype filters out frequency areas lower than 70Hz, base frequency of ENF at 60Hz region are removed and suppressed. That is, LISTEN attack cannot be successful because of the absence of ENF signals at the base frequency. However, we can construct ENF signals by combining and extracting harmonics.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, in the case of Torfone, we can see that base ENF signal also remained around 60Hz as shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>-(3) although packet loss exists in case of Torfone such as shown in 2D spectrogram. Since Torfone uses Tor-network for voice chatting, the frequency bandwidth of communication channel cannot digest the bandwidth of audio channel. Therefore, even though Tor-network uses TCP network, Torfone over Tor network frequently drops the lately arrived packets by force in order to provide real-time communication through its own codec.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-33">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">5.3</span> Inter-grid estimation</h3>     </div>    </header>    <p>Given a sample data set with annotated region IDs, we infer the power grid ID of a new sample of interest in the inter-grid estimation. For this experiment, we initially extracted 99 audio streams at the same time but only 68 audio streams are finally used because 31 audio streams which do not have ENF signals are removed. These streams were located in 7 power grids, which are Eastern and Western Interconnection of the United States, Central and Northern Power grid of Europe, Brazil, Peru and Cuba. Leave-one-out cross-validation is used to evaluate the inter-grid estimation. We partition the data into a training dataset with 67 streams and a testing dataset with 1 stream. We repeatedly run 68 different runs to obtain sound statistics. With this cross-validation, we measured the accuracy of the classification with varying the length of segment as shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a>. This figure shows that the accuracy of the experiment has the highest value at 90.77% when the segment length is 40 minutes.

We surmise that the tested ENF signals were categorized into three groups depending on geographic origins. 76.4% of samples (group 1) were clearly identified even with a short segment because their origins were located very far from each other. About 6% of samples (group 2) were uniquely distinguished when the segment length is between 30 and 35 minutes - this is because their uniqueness was obtained only with a longer segment. We failed to uniquely identify the remaining samples (group 3) even with a longer 40-minute segment.

In particular, the raw audio stream data being transmitted need to be produced through an AC microphone.

Noisy 50 or 60Hz signals can be inserted before transmitting stream data to attacker&#x0027;s device or uploading a recorded stream file to a streaming server. Added noise will make it more difficult to extract original ENF signals. This countermeasure needs to be designed carefully though as insertion of pure random noise might not be effective &#x2013; pure random signals can be easily removed through a noise cancellation filter such as the <em>median</em> filter. A more ideal way of generating noise signals is to randomly choose <em>fake</em> signals from a collected set of real-world ENF signals.

For example, we can use the band-stop filter to remove only ENF signals at the specific range of frequency band since the band-stop filter passes most frequencies of audio data unaltered but removes restricted small frequency region. The band-stop filtering techniques have been studied comprehensively in the field of signal processing&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0041">41</a>].</p>    </section>    </section>    <section id="sec-40">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">6.2</span> LISTEN attack limitations</h3>     </div>    </header>    <p>Although the LISTEN attack can be effectively used to identify recording places of content creators or physical location of VoIP users, the attack provides coarse-grained location information within a given a power grid (see Section&#x00A0;<a class="sec" href="#sec-33">5.3</a>).

In such environments, location cannot be accurately pinpointed.

Using this result, Coskun and Memon proposed robust hashing scheme for VoIP packet to track VoIP calls.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] They suggest hashing scheme which is able to pair original packet streams to distorted streams after delay, jitter, and packet drops. However, though its robustness can be applied in impairments-existent conditions, there are some limitations to apply their scheme to actually tacking VoIP callers. Since it is only able to check whether two packet streams store the same (or similar) data, it is needed to monitor all packets to identify pairs among all possible nodes and this complexity isn&#x0027;t reduced if we could control one endpoint.</p>    </section>   </section>   <section id="sec-45">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">8</span> Conclusion</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>Unlike existing location inference techniques&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0039">39</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>] that require installation of a malicious application on a victim&#x0027;s device and an expensive ENF receiver, the proposed LISTEN attack can be performed with access to just the target video or audio file.</p>    <p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of the LISTEN attack, we experimented with the multimedia data collected from three online streaming services, Earthcam, Skyline, and Explore, as well as two VoIP applications, Skype, and Torfone. Our results show that the LISTEN attack can be highly effective in inferring the physical location of which a video or audio file was recorded. We achieved an accuracy of 76% which is a reasonable level when the multimedia source was 5 minutes or longer.</p>    <p>Our LISTEN attack is currently limited to the multimedia files recorded with mains-powered microphones. For generalization, we also plan to design ENF signals-based attacks for environments where mains-powered microphones are not used.</p>    <p>Although we positioned the findings as a way to perform an inference attack, our techniques could also be used to identify locations of criminals such as kidnappers, terrorists, or phishers who use multimedia to threaten and abuse people. Another future work is to extend our findings to develop such countermeasure technologies.</p>   </section>  </section>  <section class="back-matter">   <section id="ref-001">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2 class="page-brake-head">REFERENCES</h2>    </div>    </header>    <ul class="bibUl">    <li id="BibPLXBIB0001" label="[1]">M.
