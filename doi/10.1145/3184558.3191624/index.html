        <p><small>Depression is among the most commonly diagnosed
        mental disorders around the world. With the increasing
        popularity of online social network platforms and the
        advances in data science, more research efforts have been
        spent on understanding mental disorders through social
        media by analysing linguistic style, sentiment, online
        social networks and other activity traces. However, the
        role of basic emotions and their changes over time, have
        not yet been fully explored in extant work. In this paper,
        we proposed a novel approach for identifying users with or
        at risk of depression by incorporating measures of eight
        basic emotions as features from Twitter posts over time,
        including a temporal analysis of these features. The
        results showed that emotion-related expressions can reveal
        insights of individuals’ psychological states and emotions
        measured from such expressions show predictive power of
        identifying depression on Twitter. We also demonstrated
        that the changes in an individual's emotions as measured
        over time bear additional information and can further
        improve the effectiveness of emotions as features, hence,
        improve the performance of our proposed model in this
        task.</small></p>

      <p>Common mental disorders including depression, bipolar
      affective disorder, dementia and schizophrenia affect about
      410 million people globally, among which depression alone
      affects around 350 million people, making it the world's
      fourth largest disease <a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="fn" href="#fn2" id=
      "foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Depression, as one of the most
      prevalent forms of mental health problems, is associated with
      substantially increased morbidity and mortality [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]. Major
      depressive disorder occurs within youth populations at
      comparable rates to adult populations [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>], with nearly 25% of young
      people going to experience an episode of major depression by
      the age of 19 [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>]. The World Health Organization
      estimates that depression is now the second leading cause of
      worldwide disability adjusted life years<a class="fn" href=
      "#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Despite the increasing
      knowledge and awareness, a considerable amount of individuals
      with depression remain undetected and untreated, leading to
      serious public health problems [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>].</p>
      <p>With the increasing engagement with social media of the
      public, many studies showed that social media has already
      been increasingly used in population health monitoring
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>], and is
      beginning to be used for mental health applications
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. Employing
      social media has been suggested to be beneficial to mental
      health studies, as it provides an unbiased collection of
      individuals’ language usages and behaviours [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]. Additionally,
      information from social media bears the potential to
      complement traditional survey techniques in its ability to
      provide finer grained measurements of behaviour over time
      while dramatically expanding population sample sizes
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]. Initial
      evidence has been found to show that people do post about
      their depression and their treatments on social media
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>]. And
      numerous studies have presented that based on the symptoms
      and indicators of depression, it is possible to use data
      mining and machine learning techniques to develop models to
      discover likely instances of depression on social media.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigated the potential of both
      non-temporal and temporal measures of emotions from Twitter
      posts over time in identifying users with depression over a
      control group (users who do not suffer from depression). We
      detected eight basic emotions (e.g. anger, fear, etc.) from
      each tweet as its message content attributes and calculated
      the strength scores based on the intensity of each
      expression. These attributes and strength scores were used
      first to calculate the average intensity of each emotion
      expression from each user's past tweets, and subsequently for
      a time series analysis of each user, creating two feature
      sets to build classifiers that label Twitter users as either
      belonging to the depression or non-depression (control)
      groups. The results show that by leveraging the averaged
      intensity of emotional expressions, our classifier was able
      to outperform the baseline and other prediction models in
      identifying users with depression. And the accuracy improved
      further when employing the descriptive statistics of the
      emotion time series as inputs to the training process. Hence,
      this suggests that emotion related expressions from tweets
      can reveal insights of individuals’ psychological states and
      that the changes of an individual's emotions over time bear
      additional information with promising potential in
      identifying users with depression. The main contributions of
      this work is, for the prediction and detection of mental
      health conditions on social media, we (1) employed emotions
      as features, (2) applied time series analysis, and (3)
      explored the effectiveness of temporal measures of these
      features for the task of identifying users who suffer from
      depression on social media.</p>

      <p>During the past decade, there have been an increasing
      number of studies investigating mental health issues using
      social media datasets. These studies explored features based
      on known symptoms and indicators of mental disorders and
      showed that it is possible to develop automatic detection
      systems for mental health problems using existing tools and
      methods from data mining, text mining, social network
      analysis and machine learning. A wide range of mental health
      conditions have been studied including major depressive
      disorder [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=

      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>].</p>
      <p>Including identifying depression from Twitter, the
      majority of these studies focused on the analysis of textual
      contents in the English language from publicly available data
      sources on social media. A few features were most frequently
      used for understanding individuals’ psychological states.
      Linguistic patterns, often obtained by using the well-known
      Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>], were employed to extract
      potential signals from textual content such as first, second,
      third person pronouns, perceptual process related words, or
      positive and negative emotion words [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>]. Sentiment analysis using
      tools like OpinionFinder [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0039">39</a>], SentiStrength [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>] and Affective Norms for
      English Words (ANEW) [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>], were also frequently interoperated
      for quantifying the sentiment and emotion attributes from
      textual expressions [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. Besides, emoticons and images have
      also been utilized for detecting positive and negative
      sentiments from a social media post [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. As a part of content
      analysis, various types of topic modelling such as LDA and
      TAM were incorporated in order to extract topics, sometimes
      more specifically ailment related topics [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>], from user generated
      contents [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>].
      Most social media platforms also provide interactive
      features, which allow users to follow or un-follow another
      user, add or remove a friend, mention, reply to a user or a
      post, repost, and comment. Due to these interactive features,
      network analysis was applied in some studies to understand
      users’ online social activities, their relationships, and
      interactions with others [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>]. The influences of personality, age
      and gender on the disclosure of mental health problems were
      also examined [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>]. These attributes were utilised for
      creating a matched control group of similar age, gender
      according to the users included in the condition group, in
      order to reduce this biases for the analysis of the
      differences in features from the condition group compared to
      the control [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>].</p>
      <p>Prediction models are often used to perform this task with
      a selection of extracted features from the above-mentioned
      analysis to learn patterns from the data. To the best of our
      knowledge, all prediction models used supervised learning
      techniques, where the sample data contain labels for both the
      inputs as training and the outputs as true labels for
      evaluating the prediction performance.</p>
      <p>In spite of these research efforts, little attention has
      been given to the emotional factors for understanding or
      analysing specific mental disorders on social media. For the
      task of detecting depression as well as other mental
      disorders, discrete basic emotions have not yet been
      leveraged, and their predictive power has not yet been fully
      examined. As many psychological phenomena occur in small time
      windows, <em>affective micropatterns</em> in language have
      recently been explored for quantifying mental health signals
      from Twitter [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>], considering the temporal dimension
      for the first time in mental health research on social media.
      Similar to our work, the authors also suggested the study of
      emotions to be an important avenue for further work in this
      research field. Therefore, with the present work we aim to
      (1) expand the scope of sentiment analysis for mental
      disorder detection, using measurements of eight basic
      emotions expressed through Twitter posts as features; (2)
      capture the changes of individuals’ emotions over time, by
      applying time series analysis on the measurements of emotions
      to produce a set of temporal features; (3) examine and
      demonstrate the effectiveness of these features for
      identifying users suffering from depression.</p>

      <p>Among social media platforms, Twitter provides a unique
      source of big data for public health research due to the
      real-time nature of the content, and ease in accessing and
      retrieving publicly available information [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>]. The increasing amount of
      research and technique development on Twitter related to text
      mining, sentiment analysis, public health surveillance and
      prediction highlights the significance of this stream of
      social media data. However, there is not yet a gold standard
      dataset available for mental health related research on
      social media, therefore data collection was performed for the
      purpose of this study.</p>
      <section id="sec-8">
        <header>
          <div class="title-info">
            <h3><span class="section-number">3.1</span> Data
            Collection</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>In general, there are two broad approaches for social
        media data collection in the literature: (1) employing
        means like surveys, crowdsourcing to attract participants
        and collect data from their social media account directly
        with their consent; (2) using available Application
        Programming Interface (API) of social media platforms to
        extract and aggregate relevant data from public posts. In
        this study, we chose the second approach to pool public
        posts from Twitter.</p>
        <p>First, in order to identify a group of users who suffer
        from depression. We first collected self-reported diagnosis
        tweets using Twitter streaming API with the regular
        expression “I was/have been diagnosed with depression”,
        following the Twitter data acquisition process described in
        work [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]. The duration of the collection
        process lasted four months: from November 18th 2016 to
        February 15th 2017. These diagnosis tweets were not
        formally analysed for filtering out disingenuous
        statements. However, all retweets were removed, since they
        are often an indication of the message being a quotation of
        others’ post, which is not originally produced by the user
        tweeting, hence, analysing their user profiles would be
        misguided. For instance, “<em>RT @User_screenname: I was
        diagnosed with depression before they knew what gender I
        was. Url_links</em>”. We considered these diagnosis
        statements as a qualification to obtain a list of user
        <em>screen names</em> of whom are likely having a genuine
        depression disorder, and formed the depression group of
        this study. In a similar manner, we collected one day
        (February 20th 2017) of tweets containing the keyword “the”
        using Twitter Streaming API to collect a group of users who
        can represent the general public. The obtained user
        <em>screen names</em> were double checked against the
        depression group to make sure the two groups have no
        overlap that may interfere with the training process later
        on. We then used this list of users as the control
        group.</p>
        <p>Next, for individuals in the depression group, all
        tweets up to one year before the diagnosis tweets were
        posted were retrieved to capture the user generated
        contents, which might contain information and patterns of
        the user's depressive state. The past tweets of users from
        the control group were collected in the same manner to
        match the depression dataset. In this process, no private
        messages or user accounts were accessible to the
        researchers, and all collected data were publicly posted on
        Twitter. Users who had less than 50 tweets, or often post
        in non-English languages do not meet the requirements for
        the analysis in this study, therefore, they were filtered
        out. After this process, we obtained 585 and 6,596 unique
        and valid users with their past tweets (in average 2,000
        per user) as the depression and the control group datasets,
        respectively. However, we only chose a random sample of 600
        users from the control group to create a balanced dataset
        with roughly equal number of positive (depression) and
        negative (non-depression) instances for the later
        classification experiments.</p>
        <p>This data collection method has been previously
        validated by various studies of depression and other mental
        health conditions through replication of previous findings
        and showing predictive power for real-world phenomena

        <p>In general, both groups show an increase of tweet volume

        with the daily activity pattern of the general public.
        Around 3 am, the average number of tweets reaches the
        lowest for both groups, when people are most likely to be
        in sleep. Evenings and early nights show peaks, indicating
        that people tend to tweet more at the end of the day after
        finishing work or school. Although with a similar pattern,
        it can be observed that the depression group shows a higher
        peak in the evening (after 6pm), and a lower tweet volume
        during the day. This suggested that users with depression
        tend to have more night time online activities and

        </header>
        <p>Emotions are an important element of human nature, thus
        they have been widely studied in many research areas such
        as neuroscience, psychology and behavioural sciences
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. In
        particular, numerous psychological studies examined the
        correlation between emotions, eating disorders, and other
        health issues. More recently, psychologists have also been
        exploring such signals from social media [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]. However, emotion-based
        features have not yet been considered nor incorporated in
        the analysis of mental health related social media
        datasets. Therefore, we propose to employ discrete emotions
        in the task of identifying depression.</p>
        <p>For this study, we considered measures of eight well
        recognised basic emotions: <em>Anger, Disgust, Fear,
        Happiness, Sadness and Surprise</em>, also known as Ekman's
        basic emotions [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>], <em>shame</em>, which was
        tentatively included into the list of basic primary
        emotions, in Ekman's later work based on emerging evidence
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>], and
        <em>Confusion</em>. Although confusion has traits that are
        often associated with emotions (e.g. specific distinct
        facial expressions), it is nevertheless, in the emotion
        research literature, mostly considered to be a state rather
        than an emotion, similar to concentration or worry
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>].
        Nonetheless, Rozin and Cohen (ibid.) pointed out that given
        its clear negative valence, confusion could arguably be
        considered as an emotional affect, although it is perhaps
        under more voluntary control than the standard emotions.
        They (ibid.) further suggested that confusion was very
        common and almost unstudied. Given the high frequency of
        confusion expression and the potential discriminatory value
        to general emotional well-being, <em>Confusion</em> was
        therefore included in this study. Along with the eight
        basic emotions, <em>Emotion Overall Score</em>, which is a
        sum of strength scores of all emotions, was also included
        as a measure of overall emotionality (i.e. emotion
        activation).</p>
        <p>To detect and measure these fine-grained emotions from
        individuals’ tweets, we employed the EMOTIVE system, an
        ontology (semantic model) based advanced sentiment
        algorithm, developed by [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>]. It is a map of emotion related
        words and phrases including a set of intensifiers,
        conjunctions, negators, interjections, and linguistic
        analysis rules, i.e. EMOTIVE ontology. This ontology,
        therefore, allows a richer semantic representation than the
        traditional lexicon and discovers emotions with their
        expression intensities as strength scores. The system first
        parses the text and classifies part-of-speech tags through
        a Natural Language Processing pipeline. Emotion related
        expressions are then matched by comparing the parsed words
        against the EMOTIVE ontology. A strength score is produced
        by accumulating the intensity measures of matched
        intensifiers for each detected emotion expression. And a
        strength score of zero is given to the rest of the emotions
        indicating there is no expression intensity of the emotion,
        i.e. the emotion is not expressed in the post. The EMOTIVE
        system was evaluated and compared against other benchmarks
        in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>], in which it showed a 0.962
        f-measure in detecting emotions from Twitter posts, making
        EMOTIVE to be a highly suitable tool for our study.</p>

        <p>This work aims to investigate the effectiveness of
        emotion based features and their temporal dimension for
        identifying depression from Twitter. Therefore, two types
        of features were created from the emotion measurements. We
        (1) calculated the overall intensity (strength score) of
        the emotions extracted from all past tweets of each user,
        and (2) created a time series for each emotion of every
        user to generate a selection of descriptive statistics for
        these time series. These two sets of features were
        subsequently employed as inputs for the task of identifying
        users with depression condition.</p>

        expression measurements as described in the previous

        feature vector with 9 entries, i.e. <em>Emotion Overall
        Score, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise,
        Shame, Confusion</em>. The resulting emotion feature

        </header>
        <p>In order to capture the hidden information carried by
        emotion expressions over time, we conducted time series
        analysis on the strength scores of these expressions. We
        first obtained 9 emotion strength scores for each tweet
        using the emotion sensor. To each strength score generated
        by the emotion sensor, we assigned a time stamp as the
        posting time of the tweet, from which the score was
        calculated from. Therefore, from each user we obtain a
        sequence of measurements as a signal over time for each
        emotion expression. These sequences were then used to
        create nine emotion time series (i.e. <em>Emotion Overall
        Score, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise,
        Shame, Confusion</em>) for every user. Each time series was
        created by the summation of the accumulated expression
        strength scores with the same date. This is due to the
        reason that most users do not tweet several times a day and
        only around 10% of the tweets contain emotion expressions.
        Hence, using one day as the unit of the emotion time series
        is more suitable than using the actual tweet time and is
        able to capture a more continuous signal. Note that a score
        of zero was assigned to the date when no tweet was found,
        or when no emotion expression was detected.</p>
        <p>Next, a selection of descriptive statistics were
        calculated as temporal features for each time series. Given
        a time series <em>X</em> <sub>1</sub>, <em>X</em>

        machine learning classifiers was incorporated in order to
        find the the most suitable one for further exploration.
        These classifiers are the Logistic Regression (LR), Support
        Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayesian (NB), Decision Trees

      <p>We first validated the ability of EMOTIVE to capture
      various emotion aspects of the public. To do so, we aggregate
      all users from the control group and calculated the mean
      emotion strength scores for every day in 2016. The resulting
      expression intensity distributions of the the eight emotions
      over the year are shown in Figure <a class="fig" href=
      "#fig2">2</a>. Despite the sparsity of emotions expressed
      through Twitter, the figure shows that the EMOTIVE has
      successfully identified the public emotional response to
      festivals and important events happened in 2016 as annotated
      on the graph. <em>Happiness</em> peaks with several well
      known festivals in English speaking countries, accompanied by
      a decrease of <em>Sadness</em>. For festivals that involve
      giving and receiving gifts, a raise of the <em>Surprise</em>
      signal can be observed shortly before and or after the day,
      such as Valentine's Day, Mother's Day and Christmas. Two
      major events have also been captured by the EMOTIVE, on 23
      June and 8 November when the Brexit and the US Presidential
      Election took place. Both events caused a significant
      increase of <em>Sadness</em>. Besides, peaks of
      <em>Disgust</em> can be noticed in the next couple days of
      the Brexit. And the US Election results seems to have caused
      a considerable raise of <em>Fear</em>.</p>
      <p>In Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>, we compared
      each of these emotion signals (from the control group
      coloured in blue) against the depression group (in orange).
      As we can see, except <em>Happiness</em> and
      <em>Surprise</em>, all emotion signals have more and higher
      peaks from the depression group than from the control group,
      which suggests that users who suffer from depression express
      these emotions more frequently and intensely. An overall
      higher expression intensity from the depression group can be
      observed in <em>Sadness</em>, <em>Disgust</em> and
      <em>Fear</em>. For the depression group, Mother's and
      Father's Day seem to trigger a stronger signal in
      <em>Shame</em>. Studies have shown that feelings of shame and
      guilt are factors associated with depression [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. While guilt is a feeling
      of doing wrong, <em>Shame</em> is a feeling of being wrong.
      Hence, <em>Shame</em>, in contrast to guilt, elicits
      rumination, which then leads to depression [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>]. Overall, an increase of
      negative emotions including <em>Anger</em>, <em>Disgust</em>,
      <em>Fear</em>, <em>Sadness</em>, and <em>Shame</em> can be
      observed from the depression group compare to the control
      group. These insights are in line with previous findings that
      depressed users use negative emotion words and anger words on
      Twitter more frequently, while there are no notable
      differences in positive emotion word usage [<a class="bib"

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Following our proposed framework, the initial prediction
        experiment was conducted as a binary classification task in
        separating users with self-reported depression from the
        control users. This experiment was designed to examine the
        predictive power of the non-temporal emotion features, and
        to discover a suitable machine learning classifier for
        further experimentation. The selected machine learning
        classifiers are the LR, SVM, NB, DT and RF, for each
        classifier parameters was optimised with random grid search
        CV using the training data.</p>
        <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> presents the
        accuracy results of a leave-one-out cross validation of
        each classier on this prediction task using three feature
        sets, the EMO, LIWC, and EMO+LIWC. Among all experiment
        results, a precision of 0.719 was obtained from the
        depression detection performance using the LR classifier
        with the LIWC feature set, which is slightly higher than
        the result reported in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] (0.68). This could be due to the
        differences between datasets and feature normalisation
        methods, since the data preprocessing steps were not
        described in the work of [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]. However, the difference of the
        performances is not significant with the same LIWC features
        produced from different datasets. Hence the replicated LIWC
        feature set is valid and its effect in performance could be
        considered as a valid baseline for comparison with our
        proposed approach.</p>
        <p>For all algorithms, the EMO feature set appeared to be
        more effective than the LIWC, improving the accuracy by
        nearly 10%, which indicated that emotion related features
        are more relevant and straight forward in capturing
        depressive patterns than basic linguistic features. The
        combined feature set EMO+LIWC achieved the best prediction
        performance, by a slight advantage in accuracy (in average
        1.63%) than the EMO feature set, except for the NB
        classifier. This suggests that there might be an overlap of
        the information contained in the two feature sets, and more
        is captured by the EMO feature set. In all cases, by
        employing the emotion features (EMO) the prediction models
        outperformed the chance classification baseline (50%), and
        all prediction accuracies reached above 80%, which also
        outperformed the prediction models in [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>], precision of 0.48 at
        10% false alarm for depression specifically, and [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>], mean
        prediction accuracy of 68.42%. Across classifiers, the
        performances appear to be consistent for each feature set.
        The SVM classifiers achieved the highest classification
        accuracy on the LIWC (75.61%) and EMO+LIWC (88.88%), while
        the RF classifier achieved the best performance on the EMO
        (87.27%) feature set. However, the differences of the
        performances of these two classifiers were minor. And
        considered that the RF is a non-linear classifier while the
        SVM is linear, we decided to experiment with both
        classifiers for the following prediction task with the
        temporal feature sets.</p>

        <p>We have discovered that emotions carry predictive
        information that can reveal users’ depression state. In
        this section, we investigated whether the temporal features
        can provide additional information and improve the
        prediction model even further. Again, we performed the
        binary classification task to separate users with
        self-reported depression from the control users with the
        temporal feature set (EMO_TS) using the best performing
        linear (SVM) and non-linear (RF) classifier from the
        previous experiment, with optimised parameters.</p>

        <p>RF classifier performed the best with
        <em>n_estimator=10</em> (the number of estimated trees in
        the forest), and <em>max_depth = 6</em> (the maximum tree
        depth) on our feature set. And the SVM classifier performed
        the best with a RBF kernel function. Table <a class="tbl"
        href="#tab1">1</a> presents the performance of the
        classification using different feature sets with evaluation
        measures of respectively the SVM and the RF classifier.</p>
        <p>For the SVM classifier, using the temporal feature set
        EMO_TS did not produce better performance than EMO with
        approximately 6% reduce in accuracy, but still outperformed
        the LIWC feature set by 5% with the leave-one-out cross
        validation. For the RF classifier on the other hand, EMO_TS
        increased 2% accuracy compared to EMO, and nearly 10%
        compared to the SVM with EMO_TS. The best performance
        resulted by the temporal emotion features alone (EMO_TS)
        was achieved by the RF classifier with 89.77% accuracy of a
        leave-one-out cross validation. This might indicates that
        the RF classifier is able to leverage more information from
        the temporal features and perform better with greater
        number of features.</p>
        <p>For both classifiers, when combined with EMO_TS, the
        combined feature sets appeared to be more effective and
        improve the classification accuracy, and the best
        performances were achieved when using the combination of
        all three feature sets 89.83% and 92.17% for the SVM and
        the RF classifiers respectively. The accuracies of using
        emotions improved by 8% for the SVM and 3%for the RF
        classifier by adding the temporal measures to the
        non-temporal emotion features (i.e. using EMO+EMO_TS).
        These improvements show that the temporal measures of
        emotions can capture more information in addition to the
        average intensities of emotions and that time series
        analysis and temporal measures of emotions over time can
        improve the effectiveness of emotion features on this
        prediction task. To extend this work, it would be of great
        interest to measure other types of features over time, such
        as linguistic style, pattern of life, and online social
        activities, to capture more meaningful patterns that can
        provide more detailed insights into depression as well as
        other types of mental disorders from social media.</p>

      <p>This work is the first to employ fine-grained emotions for
      identifying mental disorders, and to implement time series
      analysis for the detection of mental health condition on
      social media. It demonstrated the potential of using discrete
      emotions as features and their temporal measurements for
      predicting depression in individuals. We first extracted
      emotions with their expression intensities as strength scores
      to create emotion features. A time series analysis was
      applied to the emotion strength scores over time and produced
      a selection of descriptive statistics as temporal features.
      By incorporating the emotion features, our model outperformed
      the baseline and other prediction models in [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] with 87.27%
      classification accuracy using only emotion features (EMO).
      Moreover, by employing a variety of temporal features of
      emotions over time the prediction accuracy improved even
      further, achieved 89.77% using the temporal features
      (EMO_TS), and 91.81% when our proposed emotion (non-temporal)
      and temporal feature sets were combined (EMO+EMO_TS). In
      summary, these results showed that basic emotions provide
      considerable insights in identifying twitter users who suffer
      from depression. Besides, additional information can be
      discovered by analysing these features over time. After
      learning the traces and patterns of depressed users from
      these features, the trained classifiers can be easily applied
      for detecting Twitter users with depression who did not post
      about their conditions and users who are at risk of
      depression. However, more training, testing data and in depth
      evaluation are required before any experimentation in real
      life. These findings provide a roadmap for future work in the
      research of mental health on social media. There is still
      significant work required to discover the value and meaning
      of these emotions and their temporal features in terms of
      psychological understanding and intervention. However,
      fine-grained emotions and the dynamics of their temporal
      variables is certainly worth more in depth exploration for
      our future studies.</p>
