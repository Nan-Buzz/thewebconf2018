        <p><small>The collaborative knowledge base Wikidata is the
        central storage of Wikimedia projects, containing over 45
        million data items. It acts as the hub for interlinking
        Wikipedia pages about a specific item in different
        languages, automates features such as infoboxes in
        Wikipedia, and is increasingly used for other applications
        such as data enrichment and question answering. Tracking
        the quality of Wikidata is an important issue for this
        project. In this paper we focus particularly on the
        <em>completeness</em> aspect. Several automated techniques
        have been adopted by Wikis to track and manage
        completeness, yet these techniques are generally subjective
        and do not provide a clear quality estimate at the level of
        entities. In this paper, we present an approach towards
        measuring <em>Relative Completeness</em> in Wikidata by
        comparison with data present for similar entities. This
        relative completeness approach is easily scalable with the
        introduction of new classes in the knowledge base, and has
        been implemented for all available entities in Wikidata.
        The results provide an intuition on the completeness of an
        entity comparing it with other similar entities. Here, we
        present our implementation approach along with a discussion
        on strategies and open challenges.</small></p>

      <p>Wikimedia Foundation projects such as Wikipedia,
      Wiktionary, and Wikibooks are important sources of
      information to people across the globe. Wikidata, a younger
      member of the family of Wikimedia projects, is a
      collaborative database that acts as a central repository of
      structured data for other Wikimedia projects, and provides
      structured data for a variety of other applications, ranging
      from museum metadata to political transparency and scientific
      publications.</p>
      <p>Wikidata enables for instance the automatic generation of
      infoboxes across language version of Wikipedia, and even
      allows one to import facts directly into article bodies. This
      way, if for instance a player changes his team, a single
      change in Wikidata could be sufficient to update information
      in all (currently) 288 language versions. Several other
      features of Wikipedia such as list generation on a particular
      type or related link suggestions, make use of the data from
      Wikidata.</p>

      <p>Given the size of the Wikidata project and its impact, it
      is important to supplement editors with capabilities to
      assess the quality, and in particular the completeness of
      Wikidata. <em>Completeness is a data quality measure that
      refers to the degree to which all required information is
      present in a particular dataset</em>&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. Traditional databases
      are modeled for well-defined domains, with a specific schema
      defining the contents that can be added to the database. In
      these cases, completeness of an entity can be easily measured
      by checking whether all attributes foreseen by the schema
      have a value that is not null. Wikidata, on the contrary, is
      an open-domain knowledge base without a fixed schema. While
      there are a few core properties such as <em>date of
      birth</em> or <em>place of birth</em> that are virtually
      mandatory for the class human, it is possible to express over
      4200 properties in Wikidata for various classes, many only
      applying in specific circumstances (think of <em>place of
      detention</em> or <em>monastic order</em>), thus making a
      strict definition of data that should be present
      impossible.</p>
      <p>Previous work on Wikidata quality has focused on the
      property level, i.e., assessing whether data for a specific
      property of an entity is complete&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. Given authoritative
      sources, it is relatively easy to check whether Wikidata
      contains all clubs that Antoine Griezmann played for, or
      whether all arrondissements of Lyon are mentioned.</p>
      <p>With the Recoin tool (Relative completeness indicator), we
      look at entity completeness, a different granularity of
      investigation. Recoin aims to help in answering the question
      <em>How complete is data about an entity in Wikidata as a
      whole?</em>, based on a relative completeness approach that
      compares the data present for a given entity with the data
      present for other, similar entities.</p>
      <p>Recoin is available as a gadget to any logged-in Wikimedia
      user.<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>
      Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> shows the output of
      Recoin for a sample entity, <em>L'Auberge du Pont de
      Collonges</em>, the only restaurant in the vicinity of Lyon
      with 3 Michelin stars.</p>

      <p>Wikidata is a free crowd-sourced knowledge base with more
      than 19k active users [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] that contains information known to
      human knowledge, and acts as a central data storage for the
      structured data to other Wikimedia projects. Any entity known
      to human knowledge can be represented in Wikidata as an
      <em>item</em> and each item can be described by the five
      following elements. (In the paper the terms <em>item</em> and
      <em>entity</em> are used interchangeably.)</p>
      <ol class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="(1)"><strong>Labels</strong>: A label
        is the most common name that an item is known by. Two items
        can carry the same label.<br /></li>
        <li id="list2" label="(2)"><strong>Description</strong>: A
        description is a short phrase to describe an
        entity.<br /></li>
        <li id="list3" label="(3)"><strong>Aliases</strong>:
        Aliases are alternative names, other than the label, that
        an entity may be known by.<br /></li>
        <li id="list4" label="(4)"><strong>Sitelinks</strong>:
        Sitelinks are links to other Wikimedia projects that
        contain information about that particular item.<br /></li>
        <li id="list5" label="(5)"><strong>Statements</strong>:
        Statements represent the information or data about that
        particular item in Wikidata. Each statement about an item
        consists of a <em>property</em> and a <em>value</em>. A
        single property may contain multiple values.<br /></li>
      </ol>
      <p>The labels, descriptions, aliases and sitelinks are
      multilingual (i.e., the details are inputted for a specific
      language and may differ between languages) whereas the
      statements are language independent as they contain the
      language-independent facts about the item.</p>

      <p>Knowing the data quality of an entity in Wikidata gives us
      insights into the quality of the database and helps the
      editors/users focus on certain entities. As Wikidata is
      created by a community of users, providing them information
      on the entity helps them curate the data better. This helps
      in improving the quality of the knowledge base.</p>

      <p>Considering the importance of high coverage of data in
      knowledge bases, research has focused on addressing the
      quality and enhancement of knowledge bases.</p>
      <p><em>Completeness of knowledge bases:</em>. For conceptual
      and pragmatic reasons, knowledge bases contain only a subset
      of the information that holds in reality, hence, are
      incomplete&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. Paulheim has studied various
      knowledge graph refinement approaches that aim to identify
      wrong information and add missing knowledge to the graph
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. All of
      them take some data source as a reference for good quality.
      He distinguishes between gold-standard strategies, which
      refer to a product of external knowledge, for instance
      annotations provided by humans, or other knowledge bases, and
      silver-standard strategies, which take the knowledge base
      itself as point of reference. He states that “scalability
      issues are only rarely addressed by current research works”
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. Aprosio et
      al. addressed the data coverage issue in DBpedia by proposing
      a distant supervision approach to extend the coverage of
      properties in the DBpedia knowledge base using Wikipedia
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]. Färber et
      al. provided criteria for analyzing the data quality of
      different knowledge bases [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. They defined metrics that evaluate
      the quality of a knowledge base by comparing it with a
      gold-standard data source. They also conducted an evaluation
      of selected classes using a manually created gold-standard
      that defines a small set of core properties that every human
      should have. Yet such an approach cannot be expected to
      scale, thus, completeness assessment of knowledge bases needs
      to utilize other techniques, such as the identification of
      trends in data&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>].</p>
      <p><em>Quality on Wikimedia projects:</em>. Quality has long
      been observed as important. In Wikipedia, various status
      indicators and templates exist to mark articles e.g.&nbsp;as
      <em>excellent</em>, <em>unsourced</em>, <em>stub-level</em>.
      Automated tools are also employed for this purpose, for
      instance the Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES)
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>], a
      web-service that can automatically predict the quality of
      articles and edits. In 2017, a competition was held about
      classifying Wikidata edits as vandalism or not, where the
      best systems could achieve 87% precision [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]. Yet quality manifests
      itself in many other ways than vandalism. The closest attempt
      at tracking completeness of Wikidata is the COOL-WD tool
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], a web
      portal that allows one to record the completeness of values
      for individual properties of entities, for instance
      universities in Lyon, or members of the French national
      soccer team. COOL-WD also aggregates these assertions into a
      single score. However, this describes only how many
      properties contain complete information, not whether the
      entity contains all relevant information. Wulczyn et al.
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>] address a
      similar issue as our paper, but on Wikipedia. They proposed a
      recommendation system to reduce the article coverage gap
      across languages, that suggests important missing articles to
      editors based on his/her interest. Their findings show that
      such curated suggestions improve the chances of being created
      by a factor of 3.2 and increase the editor engagement by a
      factor of 2 [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>].</p>
      <p>In a recent paper we developed a machine learning approach
      to predict, given an item, which of two properties people
      would find more interesting to know about&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]. Such
      pairwise preferences can be extended in various ways to a
      ranking of all properties for the item and used to suggest
      the relevant ones needed to make the item complete. To learn
      such a model, the approach uses the Wikipedia page
      corresponding to that Wikidata item. This is a limitation as
      not all items in Wikidata have a corresponding page in
      Wikipedia and also most of the existing pages contain very
      little information to extract.</p>
      <p>While there have been studies to improve the quality of
      Wikimedia projects, unlike in Wikipedia there is so far no
      tool available that gives real-time quality information on
      the level of entities.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">4</span> Approach</h2>

      </header>
      <p><em>Relative Completeness</em>. The term
      <em>completeness</em> ideally defines if the knowledge base
      captures all known information about an item in the form of
      <em>statements</em>. Intuitively, a boolean parameter should
      be sufficient to indicate if the item is complete or not. For
      a defined domain unlike Wikidata this may be feasible. Also,
      unlike for properties, for which it is largely possible to
      indicate whether they contain all values relevant to the
      item, representing entity completeness by a boolean parameter
      would convey little information as to the quality of the
      entity. Labeling an entity that has a single property as
      incomplete and an entity with over 100 properties as complete
      does not provide much specific information on their quality.
      Also identifying the complete entities is a rather hard and
      infeasible approach because of the fact that certain
      properties in Wikidata capture information that is bound to
      change over time, e.g., the property <em>medical
      condition</em> for items of type <em>human</em>.</p>
      <p>To quantify completeness under these circumstances, we
      propose the use of a <em>relative</em> notion of
      completeness: capturing recall in comparison with other,
      similar subjects. For example, to assess the completeness of
      data about Trump, one should look at the KB contents for
      other US presidents, and for assessing the completeness of a
      city, one should look at the data for similar cities.</p>
      <p>Formally, relative completeness relies on two
      components:</p>
      <ol class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list6" label="(1)">a similarity function between
        subject pairs <em>sim(S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>)</em>
        that can be used to compute a (weighted) set of similar
        subjects&nbsp;<strong>S</strong> for a subject
        <em>S</em>;<br /></li>
        <li id="list7" label="(2)">a scoring function <em>score(S,
        <strong>S</strong>)</em> that computes a score or rank for
        the completeness of <em>S</em> with regard to a set of
        comparison subjects&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>.<br /></li>
      </ol>
      <p>We detail next our instantiation of these concepts.</p>
      <p><em>Design Choices</em>.</p>
      <p>For computing entity similarity, in Recoin, we rely on a
      simple boolean similarity function that considers two
      entities as similar if they share at least one type. For
      entities of type human, we refine this by treating the values
      of their <em>occupation</em> property like types.</p>
      <p>We then compute the 5 most common properties in
      <strong>S</strong> that subject&nbsp;<em>S</em> is missing,
      and show the average frequency of these properties in the
      comparison set <strong>S</strong>, subtracted from 1, as
      <em>score</em>(<em>S</em>, <strong>S</strong>). One could
      easily use more than 5 properties, yet, the influence of
      additional properties is diminishing, so 5 properties was
      found to sufficiently describe the shape of the distribution
      of the frequency of missing properties.</p>
      <p>In the end, the score is discretized into 5 buckets as
      follows:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list8" label="•">Level 5 (Very good
        informativeness) - 100%-95% score<br /></li>
        <li id="list9" label="•">Level 4 (Good informativeness) -
        95%-90% score<br /></li>
        <li id="list10" label="•">Level 3 (Medium informative) -
        90%-75% score<br /></li>
        <li id="list11" label="•">Level 2 (Basic information) -
        75%-50% score<br /></li>
        <li id="list12" label="•">Level 1 (Very basic information)
        - 50%-0% score.<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>As an example, consider Larry Sanger, the co-founder of
      Wikipedia, who in Wikidata is listed with the professions
      <em>philosopher</em> and <em>blogger</em>. Consequently, he
      would be compared with all other philosophers and bloggers.
      The most frequent properties among these subjects that Larry
      Sanger is lacking are <em>member of</em>, <em>award
      received</em>, <em>work location</em>, <em>religion</em> and
      <em>described by source</em>, which occur in 12.09% to 6.35%
      of these types of subjects, thus leading to an average
      frequency of missing properties of 8.38%, and a completeness
      score of 91.62% (Level 4). For comparison, Trump's score is
      98.07%, while Tim Berners-Lee's score is 95.63% (each Level
      5).</p>
      <p>Both similarity and scoring function leave space for
      refinement. For computing subject similarity, a range of
      techniques such as similarity of textual descriptions or
      relatedness measures in knowledge graphs could be used (for a
      recent survey, see&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>]). For scoring subjects, it is
      desirable to use more informed techniques than simple counts,
      as frequent properties are not necessarily also important. In
      our ongoing work, we aim to devise more accurate and
      subject-specific ranking of properties&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>As stated in Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-7">4</a>,
        the average frequency of missing properties determines the
        completeness measure of an entity. In the following, we
        refer to a value of the property <em>instance of</em> as a
        class and to an item having the value as an instance of the
        class. For each property and each class, we calculate the
        frequency of the property, that is, we count how many
        instances have the property. In this way, each class gives
        rise to a specific ranking of the properties according to
        their frequency in that class.</p>
        <p>For the case of entities that are instances of multiple
        classes, we compute the <em>weighted frequency</em> of each
        property as the sum of the frequencies over those classes
        divided by the sum of the cardinalities of those classes.
        This computation is slightly different from the description
        in Sec.&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-7">4</a> insofar as
        this way, entities that share multiple occupations with the
        entity of interest are counted several times, yet a live
        computation of property frequencies is not realistic. By
        weighting property frequencies of types, it is possible to
        have these precomputed, and the difference is generally
        minor.</p>
        <p>For instance, Emmanuel Macron, the current President of
        France, has occupations <em>banker</em>,
        <em>politician</em> and <em>statesman</em>. There are 6,704
        bankers, 338,464 politicians, and 792 statesman in Wikidata
        (as of Dec-2017). Among bankers, 648 (9.7%) have the
        property work location (P937), while among politicians
        105,485 (31.2%) have, and among statesman 30 (3.8%) have.
        Thus, the final computed frequency this property is the
        weighted average, equaling <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$(\mbox{648}+\mbox{105,485}+30)/(\mbox{6,704}+\mbox{338,464}+792)

            Completeness</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Our early analysis revealed that computing the
        completeness based on all the missing properties is not
        effective. Since an entity is bound to have some less
        frequent properties missing (maybe because the properties
        are totally irrelevant) compared to other similar entities,
        the average frequency would always be very low, giving us
        no information. Conversely, if we reason about completeness
        based on the top property alone, an entity could be
        classified as minimally complete just because one major
        property would be missing. So, trying out different numbers
        of properties as the basis of our classification, and
        inspecting the results for various classes, we found that
        an optimal balance is achieved by basing the completeness
        classification on the top-5 missing properties for an
        entity.</p>
        <p>In the special case of properties related to death such
        as <em>date of death</em> or <em>place of death</em>, we
        manually created rules to filter them out whenever a person
        does not have at least one of them.</p>

        <p>The implemented tool is deployed in the hosting
        environment of toolforge, provided by Wikimedia. An

        then captured by Recoin to integrate in the webpage of

        <p>The completeness measure is represented visually in
        Wikidata by an indicator capturing the extent of
        information. Fig.&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>
        shows the output of Recoin on the Wikidata page of Antoine
        Griezmann. With Recoin, we can address the question
        established in Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-5">2</a>
        (i.e., <em>How complete is the data for Antoine
        Griezmann?</em>). Although Antoine Griezmann's page
        contains a large set of information in Wikidata, we notice
        that there are certain relevant properties that are not
        listed for him. Recoin highlights this fact, suggesting the
        most relevant missing properties and summarizing the
        completeness information in a visual indicator.</p>
        <p>Considering community feedback, a special version of the
        tool was made available that suggests only the properties

        <p>The entity count for each completeness level and the

        Recoin while the average number of properties/entity and
        average number of statements/entity are obtained from the
        Wikidata API. A property may have more than one value for
        an entity, therefore leading to a difference in the number
        of properties and the number of statements. We notice from
        the results that only 0.5% of the football players in
        Wikidata have a highly complete profile while over 40% have
        profiles that contain only basic information (level 1 and
        2).</p>
        <p>Similarly, entities that are instances of the class
        <em>submarines (Q2811)</em> were analyzed using Recoin.

        February, 2018) were found in Wikdiata for this class.
        Here, though the number of entities is very low, Recoin can
        still identify their completeness based on the other
        entities in that class. We notice that over 60% of the
        profiles contain only basic information (level 1 and

      <p>In this section we discuss the main challenges towards
      measuring and quantifying relative completeness.</p>
      <p><em>Potential Non-monotonicity</em>. The first challenge
      is the right choice of the similarity metric. Our current
      choice of considering all classes/ professions leads to some
      unexpected results. For instance, Garry Kasparov, a
      well-known chess player, is evaluated to be less complete
      than certain other rather unknown chess players, because of
      the presence of other occupations in his profile. The
      evaluation expects him to have the relevant properties of
      other occupation while the properties related to the
      occupation he is famous for are present. A potential solution
      is the use of <em>ranks</em>: The Wikidata data model allows
      one to express that certain property values are preferred
      over others, for instance, in Kasparov's case, the profession
      <em>chess player</em> is preferred over the others. Yet there
      is no equivalent solution for the case of classes, so here a
      custom class ranking would be required&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>].</p>
      <p><em>Correlation between Homogeneity and Relative
      Completeness</em>. A second issue concerning relative
      completeness is its relationship to property homogeneity. If
      in a class, all entities have nearly the same properties, all
      entities would have a good relative completeness (missing few
      of what many others have). In contrast, if a class is very
      heterogeneous, most entities would miss properties that some
      others have, thus achieving on average a worse relative
      completeness. This is for instance the case for the class
      <em>human</em>. We tackled this, thereby refining the class
      by profession, yet a correlation between homogeneity and
      relative completeness remains inherent to our approach.</p>
      <p><em>Cultural Bias</em>. Another challenge is the threat of
      cultural dominance via relative completeness. Since English
      content is the most widely used/edited, there is a strong
      influence of cultural bias from these entities. As the
      entities with most properties to a class are likely to get
      higher completeness levels, entities from other countries are
      almost always bound to get a lower completeness score as
      their page is expected to have the same level of information
      as for English entities. This effect may reduce the
      acceptance of the approach.</p>
      <p><em>Unsuitable Properties</em>. To ensure user experience,
      we manually filtered a few unsuited property suggestions
      relating to death, like <em>date of death</em> or <em>place
      of death</em>, that would otherwise be often top-ranked. Yet,
      similar properties also exist for other classes, for
      companies for instance via the property <em>dissolved,
      abolished or demolished</em>. As a manual treatment is not
      scalable, an automated approach towards identifying and
      filtering such properties would be highly desirable.</p>
      <p><em>Ontological Reasoning</em>. Our approach of measuring
      completeness is purely based on statistical distributions.
      Yet Wikidata comes with a rich ontology that could help in
      refining the assessment. Ideally, assertions such as that
      every human should have a birth date could be exploited
      directly, or constraints such as that female cyclists do not
      have a <em>male cyclist database ID</em> could be used to
      filter missing properties.</p>
      <p>Though these challenges are somewhat subjective, we
      believe that they are important aspects to address to provide
      a better experience for all users and maintain the high
      quality of Wikidata.</p>

        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In this work, we presented an approach to evaluate the
      <em>completeness</em> of entities in Wikidata. We based our
      approach on data present for other, similar entities, and
      provide a completeness indicator deployed in Wikidata as
      Recoin. We believe that objective criteria for assessing
      quality are important for resource allocation and project
      management. Recoin provides a useful first step in this
      direction. Extensions that use a more fine-grained
      identification of similar entities, and that can assess
      property relevance beyond pure frequencies are desirable.</p>
