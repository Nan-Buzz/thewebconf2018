        <p><small>Green spaces are believed to improve the well-being of users in urban areas. While there are urban research exploring the emotional benefits of green spaces, these works are based on user surveys and case studies, which are typically small in scale, intrusive, time-intensive and costly.

Using this methodology, we perform an empirical study on the effects of green spaces on user sentiments and emotions in Melbourne, Australia and our main findings are: (i) tweets in green spaces evoke more positive and less negative emotions, compared to those in urban areas; (ii) each season affects various emotion types differently; (iii) there are interesting changes in sentiments based on the hour, day and month that a tweet was posted; and (iv) negative sentiments are typically associated with large transport infrastructures such as train interchanges, major road junctions and railway tracks. The novelty of our study is the combination of psychological theory, alongside data collection and analysis techniques on a large-scale Twitter dataset, which overcomes the limitations of traditional methods in urban research.</small></p>

      </header>
      <p>Half of the world's population is living in urban areas today, and this figure is projected to increase to two-thirds of the world's population by 2050&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0044">44</a>]. With this rapid urbanization of today's cities, there is an increased emphasis on ensuring the well-being of people living in urban areas&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>]. In response, city planners have sought to incorporate green spaces in urban areas, as green spaces are believed to improve the physical and mental health of people residing in these urban areas. The importance of incorporating green spaces is also reflected in the UN's recent Sustainable Development Goals, which have a specific target to provide accessible green space for all urban residents&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0045">45</a>]. Given the importance of green spaces, this topic has also garnered the interest of researchers, increasingly so in recent years&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>].</p>
      <p>Existing research has explored the emotional benefits of green spaces in urban areas&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>]. These are largely based on user surveys, questionnaires and case studies, which are typically either small in scale or involve the explicit participation of users. Moreover, these traditional methods are often intrusive, time-intensive and costly for researchers to perform a longitudinal study or fine-grained analysis involving participants. For example, to track users with a fine-grained resolution, personal tracking devices have to be used and worn by the participants. Similarly, to study sentiment change across the different days or months, surveys would need to be regularly administered over the course of the study, which is time consuming for both researchers and participants. To overcome these challenges of traditional methods, we apply sentiment analysis techniques on geo-tagged tweets posted by Twitter users, which serves as an unintrusive way of exploring sentiment expressed in user-generated content and is also easily available on a large scale.</p>
      <p><strong>Research Objectives and Contributions</strong>. In this empirical study, we aim to examine the effects that visits to green spaces have on people's sentiments and the implications of these findings for urban planning. The novelty is the combination of psychological theory and analysis of digital traces left by Twitter users, which, as we will demonstrate, overcomes the limitations of traditional methods in urban research. In particular, we will answer the following research questions (RQ).</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="•">RQ1: How do sentiments and emotions differ in green spaces compared to urban areas?<br /></li>
        <li id="list2" label="•">RQ2: How does the time of day and season of visit to green spaces affect these sentiments and emotions?<br /></li>
        <li id="list3" label="•">RQ3: How does the proximity of green spaces affect these sentiments and emotions?<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>We apply this proposed methodology on a large set of 21.2 million tweets to better understand the relationship between green space and user sentiments, and our main findings are:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list4" label="•">Tweets in green spaces exhibit higher levels of joy, anticipation and trust (positive emotions), and lower levels of anger and fear (negative emotions), compared to tweets in urban areas.<br /></li>
        <li id="list5" label="•">While tweets in green spaces are generally more positive than tweets in urban areas, the season (spring, summer, autumn, winter) when a tweet was posted affects the various emotion levels differently in green space and urban areas.<br /></li>
        <li id="list6" label="•">In addition, we observe interesting changes in sentiments based on the hour, day and month that a tweet was posted, which reflect trends in real-life.<br /></li>
        <li id="list7" label="•">We also find a positive correlation between the sentiment polarity of tweets in urban areas and their proximity to green spaces.<br /></li>
      </ul>

      </header>
      <p>There are two streams of research that are related to our work, namely research on general Twitter-related analytics and research that examines the emotional benefits of green spaces.</p>
      <p><strong>General Twitter-related Analytics</strong>. Twitter is a popular micro-blogging social networking site that allows users to post short messages of 140 characters and share these tweets with their followers. In recent years, researchers have made extensive use of Twitter to understand many social phenomena and behaviours such as identifying popular topics&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>] or witness accounts&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>] associated with various places, studying correlations between user mobility patterns and happiness levels&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>], predicting levels of happiness, food preferences and physical activities&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>], recommending friends&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>], predicting flu outbreaks&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>], constructing interest profiles&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] and topical expertise&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0046">46</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>] of Twitter users, and numerous other applications in politics&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], academic conferences&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>], community detection&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>], travel trends&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>], crisis management&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>], crowd sensing&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>], event detection&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0052">52</a>], among others. Although Twitter has been extensively used for these purposes, Twitter has not been used for the study of green spaces and their effects on user sentiment, to the best of our knowledge.</p>
      <p><strong>Analysis of Psycho-social Response to Green Spaces</strong>. The study of green spaces in urban areas have garnered strong interest in recent years&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>], ranging from determining the appropriate levels of green spaces&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0050">50</a>] to understanding the usage patterns of urban green spaces&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>]. Among these works, we are most interested in works that study the effects of green spaces on people in urban areas. Many of these works utilized surveys or questionnaires to understand how green spaces affect personal well-being&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>], thermal comfort&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>], life expectancy of residents&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0041">41</a>], and prevalence of myopia&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. Researchers&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0043">43</a>] augmented these surveys with clinical measurements to study the correlations between green spaces and stress level, via measurements of blood pressure and salivary cortisol levels. Others&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] have also used wearable biosensors to study the physiological response of users to different types of environments. However, green space research typically rely on traditional methods based on surveys, questionnaires, case studies or wearable sensors, and has not previously used twitter data analytics to explore user sentiment. This observation is supported by recent comprehensive literature surveys of existing work on the benefits of green spaces&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>].</p>
      <p><strong>Discussion</strong>. While previous research has examined interesting aspects of Twitter and green spaces separately, we note two key differences with our study, namely: (i) while the works using Twitter-related analytics present interesting and useful understanding of some social phenomena, none of these earlier works examine topics related to green spaces or its effect on people's sentiments; and (ii) while earlier studies of green space examine how green spaces are associated with various health and well-being outcomes, they are based on surveys, questionnaires or case studies, which are typically small in scale, intrusive, time-intensive, costly, and difficult to replicate. In contrast, our study utilizes a big data driven framework based on implicit digital traces left by Twitter users, which is large in scale and non-intrusive, to study how green spaces affect user sentiments across different time periods and spatial areas.</p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.1</span> Dataset and Data Collection</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Our dataset comprises a set of 21.2 million tweets (2.2 million geo-tagged) generated by 10,510 users in Melbourne, Australia. We also have access to a green space dataset, comprising the locations and coverage of 482 green spaces (e.g., parks, gardens, green fields and other open areas) in the same city.</p>
        <p><strong>Twitter Dataset</strong>. We first describe our data collection methodology for the Twitter dataset, which was collected from Nov 2016 to Jan 2017 using the Twitter REST API. For this dataset, we employed a two-stage collection as follows:</p>
        <ol class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list8" label="(1)"><strong>Stage 1 Collection</strong>: This initial stage involves collecting all geo-tagged tweets (i.e., tagged with latitude/longitude coordinates) that are posted within a 5km × 5km grid in central Melbourne, Australia. This 5km × 5km grid is centered on approximately the Melbourne GPO building.<br /></li>
          <li id="list9" label="(2)"><strong>Stage 2 Collection</strong>: Based on the set of retrieved geo-tagged tweets (from Stage 1), we then proceed to extract the list of unique Twitter users who have posted these tweets, i.e., a set of seed users who have posted tweets in Melbourne, Australia. Thereafter, we retrieve the most recent 3,200 tweets of these users, as per Twitter API constraints, to build a tweeting profile for these users.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Green Space Dataset</strong>. We also have access to a green space dataset, provided by the City of Melbourne, which is the local government authority in charge of urban planning and regulations for the central Melbourne area. This dataset is in the form of a GeoJSON file that comprises 482 green spaces in Melbourne. These green spaces are represented by polygons, which encompasses the entire and exact area of each green space.</p>
        <p><strong>Mapping Tweets to Green Spaces</strong>. We also identified: (i) if a tweet was posted in a green space, which park was it posted from; and (ii) if this tweet was not posted in a green space, how far was it from the nearest green space. Using our collected tweets and green space dataset, we then labelled each tweet with the ID of the green space that these tweets were posted from. For tweets that were not posted from a green space (i.e., posted from an urban area), the distance to the nearest green space and the ID of this green space was identified.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Prior to performing our sentiment analysis on the tweets, we perform a number of pre-processing steps on the collected tweets. We restrict our work to using tweets that are explicitly geo-tagged as such tweets allow us to determine where they are posted from. These steps include the following:</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list10" label="•">Filtering tweets that are explicitly geo-tagged with latitude and longitude coordinates and within the 5km × 5km grid in Melbourne, Australia.<br /></li>
          <li id="list11" label="•">Selecting tweets that are written in English, based on the “language” field provided by the Twitter API. We chose to only consider English tweets as English is the main language spoken in the Australia and more importantly, focusing on one language allows us to abstract away the nuances associated with sentiment analysis based on different languages.<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a><br />

        <p>We utilize a commonly used sentiment analysis technique&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>], which involves first splitting each tweet into a series of tokens/words, then comparing each token/word to determine the sentiment category in which they belong to. Similar to these earlier work, we calculate sentiment score <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$Senti^{S}_{t}$</span></span> of a tweet <em>t</em> based on the word usage frequency of each sentiment category <em>S</em>. To account for different tweet lengths, we normalize each sentiment score <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$Senti^{S}_{t}$</span></span> by the number of words in each tweet. Based on this definition, the calculated sentiment level will take on a value in the range of [0,1], with 0 and 1 representing the weakest and strongest levels of the sentiment, respectively.</p>
        <p>For these sentiment categories, we utilize the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (EmoLex)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>], which is a widely used emotion word lexicon that has been used in many other works&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>]. The EmoLex lexicon comprises 10,170 words that are associated with the emotions of anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust, introduced in Plutchik's theory of emotions&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>].</p>
        <p>As pointed out in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>], the emotions of anger, disgust, fear and sadness are generally associated with negative sentiments, while the emotions of anticipation, joy and trust are generally associated with positive sentiments. The emotion of surprise is neutral, i.e., can belong to either category, and hence is used independently but not for the calculation of positive or negative sentiments. Thus, we define another two sentiment categories of positive (comprising the emotions of anger, disgust, fear and sadness) and negative (comprising the emotions of anticipation, joy and trust). Similar to&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>], we define the polarity of a tweet based on the difference between the positive and negative sentiment scores of a tweet.</p>

        <p>Based on our analysis, we find that there is an increase of more than 10% in joy and decrease of approximately 10% in the fear and anger emotions, for tweets posted in green spaces compared to their counter-part in urban areas. There is also an increase of 6.5%, 5.6% and 2.95% for the trust, surprise and anticipation emotions, respectively. The reported difference in the emotions of joy, fear, anger, trust, surprise and anticipation are also statistically significant, with <em>p</em>-values of less than 0.0001. While there are differences in the emotions of disgust and sadness, these differences are not statistically significant with <em>p</em>-values of more than 0.05.</p>
        <p>Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-9">4.1</a> shows that green spaces generally display higher positivity and lower negativity than urban areas, and there are higher levels of positive emotions of joy, trust and anticipation, and lower levels of negative emotions of fear and anger in green spaces than urban areas. For the negative emotions of disgust and sadness, there is insufficient evidence to indicate any differences between green spaces and urban areas. We now explore how these sentiments and emotions change over various time periods.</p>

        </header>
        <p>For our analysis of sentiments and emotions across the four seasons, we label a tweet as belonging to a particular season if this tweet was posted within the three months of the season, as widely used in Melbourne: Spring (Sep-Nov), Summer (Dec-Feb), Autumn (Mar-May), Winter (June-Aug).</p>
        <section id="sec-13">
          <p><em>5.1.1 Comparison of Sentiments Across Seasons.</em> We start our longitudinal study on tweet sentiments by first examining the level of positive, negative and polarity of tweets posted across the four seasons in green spaces and urban areas, as shown in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>. When examining levels of positive (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> a) and negative sentiments (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> b), we note that positive sentiments are higher and negative sentiments are lower in green spaces compared to urban areas, across all seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter. For both tweets in green spaces and urban areas, we also observe that negative sentiments are the highest in autumn and winter, a trend that resembles the seasonal affective disorder where “depressive symptoms occur during the winter months”<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>].</p>
          <p>Recall that a tweet can contain both positive and negative sentiments (as described in Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-7">3.3</a>), hence we use the polarity of a tweet to better measure the positivity or negativity of a tweet on its own. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> c shows that the polarity levels of tweets posted in green spaces are higher (more positive) compared to those in urban areas, regardless of the season when a tweet is posted. In particular, we observe that tweets posted in green spaces are the most positive in summer, followed by spring, autumn and winter, in an order corresponding to the temperatures associated with each season. The polarity of these tweets gives us an overview of the positivity and negativity of tweets, and we examine the emotions associated with these tweets in the following sections.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sec-14">
          <p><em>5.1.2 Comparison of Emotions Across Seasons.</em> Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> shows the average level of emotions for anticipation, joy, surprise and trust for tweets posted across the four seasons in green spaces and urban areas. The results for these positive emotions are similar to that in Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-13">5.1.1</a>, as tweets in green spaces show higher levels of anticipation, joy, surprise and trust, compared to those in urban areas in the same season. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> b shows that the emotion of joy is most prevalent out of all four emotions, with the highest levels for tweets in both green spaces and urban areas. In general, the results show that tweets in green spaces evoke more positive emotions of anticipation, joy, surprise and trust.</p>
          <p>Next, we examine the average levels of emotions for anger, disgust, fear and sadness, as shown in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>. In terms of the emotions of anger (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> a) and fear (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> c), tweets in green spaces show lower levels of these negative emotions, compared to its counterparts in urban areas in the same season. In terms of the emotions of disgust (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> b) and sadness (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> d), we observed mixed results where there are no clear “winners” between tweets posted in green spaces and urban areas, i.e., green spaces exhibit lower levels of these emotions in some seasons but not others. In all cases for tweets in green spaces, we note that the lowest levels of anger, disgust, fear and sadness are found during summer, an observation similar to that of the seasonal affective disorder where depressive symptoms are less likely during summer months&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>].</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>After examining how sentiments change across the seasons, we now examine how these sentiments change across finer time periods of hours, days and months, as shown in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>.</p>
        <p>In terms of sentiments change across the hours of the day (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> a), e.g., 12am, 1am, 2am, etc, we notice that the sentiment polarity of tweets becomes lower (less positive) from approximately 12-1pm onward until reaching a trough at 4-5pm, before increasing drastically thereafter. While this trend applies to both green spaces and urban areas, the change during this time period is more pronounced for tweets in green spaces. We attribute this due to the fact that most people are either at work (or school) from 8am to 5pm, and they become more negative towards the end of this work cycle, i.e, 12pm to 4 pm. However, the recovery period (work detachment and relaxation) takes place at the end of this work cycle&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0039">39</a>] and sentiment of the person improves through the evening, i.e., 5 pm onwards. Similarly, social scientists have also noted that “positive emotion runs high in the morning, declines throughout the day, and rebounds in the evening”&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>].</p>
        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> b shows the change in sentiment based on the day of the week. Psychological studies have shown that people tend to be happier during weekends&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0040">40</a>] and our Twitter-driven study shows the same observation, as indicated by higher levels of sentiment polarity during Sat and Sun for both green spaces and urban areas. While there is a trend of more positivity during weekends, we also observe that tweets are consistently more positive in green spaces compared to urban areas, regardless of the day a tweet was posted.</p>
        <p>The sentiment changes across the months (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> c) show that sentiments in green spaces are the lowest (most negative) in May, i.e., the end of Autumn, before gradually increasing to a peak in December, i.e., the start of summer. While there are some variations in tweet sentiments in urban areas, we note that there are no obvious trends in sentiment change for urban areas. These results shows a finer grained analysis of how sentiments change across the months, while displaying the same general trends of how sentiments change across the broader seasons (as discussed in Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-14">5.1.2</a>).</p>

        <p>For a broader-scale understanding of sentiments in Melbourne, we perform a grid-based analysis of sentiment polarity within the same city, where each 250m grid comprises the aggregated sentiment polarity of all tweets within that grid. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a> shows the result of this analysis where blue grids indicate positive sentiments and red grids indicate negative sentiments, while deeper colours indicate a higher level of that sentiment.</p>
        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a> shows that most of the grids with negative sentiments are relating to areas that contain large transport infrastructures (train stations, road junctions, railway tracks) or residential areas. Most of the grids containing green spaces exhibit positive sentiments with the exception of one grid that contains a hospital (which has since shifted), where most tweets mention about visiting patients or going for their cancer treatments.</p>

        <p>To understand how the proximity of green spaces affects user sentiments in urban areas, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients between the sentiment levels of urban tweets and their distance to the nearest green space. Tables&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab3">3</a> and&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab4">4</a> shows the results of this correlation test in terms of sentiments (positive, negative, polarity) and emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust), respectively.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">7</span> Discussion of Main Findings</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In this section, we first highlight the main findings of our study, then discuss some implications of these findings in urban planning. Our main findings of how green spaces affect user sentiment are:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list14" label="•">RQ1: In general, tweets in green spaces are more positive and less negative than those in urban areas. When we examine these changes in terms of specific emotions, green spaces exhibit higher levels of joy, anticipation and trust (positive emotions), and lower levels of anger and fear (negative emotions), compared to urban areas.<br /></li>
        <li id="list15" label="•">RQ2: While green spaces are generally more positive than urban areas, the season when a tweet was posted affects the various emotions differently. We observe that green spaces display higher polarity (more positive) than urban areas across the four seasons, with warmer seasons (spring and summer) being more positive and colder seasons being less negative.<br /></li>
        <li id="list16" label="•">RQ2: Breaking down our analysis in terms of hours and days, the results show sentiment changes that reflect the general lifestyle of users. For example, sentiment polarity is the lowest at the end of a work day (early evening) before gradually increasing through the evening after work. Similarly, sentiments are more positive during weekends than weekdays, with green spaces being more positive than urban areas across all days.<br /></li>
        <li id="list17" label="•">RQ3: Our grid-based analysis show that areas containing major transport-related infrastructures and residential areas are more likely to show negative sentiments, while almost all areas with green spaces exhibit positive sentiments (with the exception of an area that contained both a green space and a hospital).<br /></li>
        <li id="list18" label="•">RQ3: Examining urban tweets, we find a correlation between the sentiment polarity of urban tweets and its distance to the nearest green space. The results show a significant negative correlation with tweets in urban areas and distance to green spaces for negative sentiments but no significant correlation for positive sentiments.<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>These findings have some important implications for urban planning authorities&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0054">54</a>] and smart city applications&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. They provide supporting evidence for policies aiming to improve well-being outcomes through urban greening interventions; people express more positive emotions and less negative emotions in green spaces or in close proximity to one. In Melbourne, this effect is particularly notable in warmer months and on weekends. At some times of the year, e.g., autumn, more negative sentiment is expressed in parks than in urban areas. Further research could explore whether these seasonal changes can be mitigated (e.g. negative sentiment could be related to mess from falling leaves, which could be mitigated through additional maintenance), or whether park use can be promoted at optimal times. In addition to urban planning, we can also improve existing tour recommendation and route planning systems&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0047">47</a>] by using our sentiment analysis approach to identify and recommend Points-of-Interest that elicit more positive sentiments.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">8</span> Conclusion</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In this paper, we studied the effects of green spaces on user sentiments based on digital traces left by Twitter users in the form of geo-tagged tweets, and presented our main findings in Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-19">7</a>. As far as we are aware, our work is the first to utilize a big data driven approach to understand how green spaces are related to user sentiments across different time periods and spatial areas. In contrast to earlier works that utilizes surveys, questionnaires and case studies, our approach utilizes a large amount of Twitter data which can be easily collected and is neither intrusive nor time-consuming for the users (as the tweets are publicly available). These properties allow an unprecedented capacity for fine-grained analysis, such as capturing all green spaces at once, studying local effects, size effects, time effects, and range effects, thus also allowing to identify gaps. Moreover, our study methodology can be easily extended to examine other research questions, and thus this type of analysis is relevant for social researchers and psychologists who are currently using independent studies and traditional methods. For example, instead of administering surveys to understand how a specific crisis or natural disaster affects people's emotional well-being, we can perform sentiment analysis on a large amount of tweets that are posted in close proximity to the natural disaster or by users residing near the natural disaster. In future, we intend to extend our study to utilize image recognition techniques alongside sentiment analysis on photo-sharing sites, similar to the studies on pet ownership and alcohol consumption using Instagram&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0051">51</a>].</p>

    <p id="fn1"><a href="#foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>Although we focus on English tweets in this work, this work can also be easily extended to any text-based social media written in other languages by using a sentiment dictionary of that language. In this work, we focus on the text/words used in tweets and future work can also consider the embedded links, photos and videos using image recognition techniques.</p>
    <p id="fn2"><a href="#foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>This “difference” is calculated by dividing the mean sentiment levels in green spaces over that of urban areas, and the reported values are based on the exact (non-rounded) sentiment levels for a higher precision, whereas the values reported in the tables are rounded to the nearest 4 decimal points for brevity.</p>
