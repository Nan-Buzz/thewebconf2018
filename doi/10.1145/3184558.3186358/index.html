        <p><small>With the increase in collaboration among
        researchers of various disciplines, changing the research
        topic or working on multiple topics is not an unusual
        behavior. Several comprehensive efforts have been made for
        predicting, quantifying, and studying the researcher's
        impact. The question, that how the change in the field of
        interest over time or working in more than one topics can
        influence the scientific impact, remains unanswered. In
        this research, we study the effect of topic drift on the
        scientific impact of an author. We apply Author Conference
        Topic (ACT) model to extract topic distribution of
        individual authors who are working on multiple topics to
        compare and analyze with authors who work on a single
        topic. We analyze the productivity of the authors on the
        basis of publication count, citation count and h-index. We
        find that authors who stick to one topic, produce a higher
        impact and gain more attention. To further strengthen our
        results we gather the h-index of top-ranked authors working
        on one topic and top-ranked authors working on multiple
        topics and examine whether there are similar trends in
        their progress. The results show an evidence of significant
        impact of topic drift on career choices of
        researchers.</small></p>

          INTRODUCTION</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Scientists are always interested in examining the truth
      and have critical questioning abilities. With the help of
      such abilities, they produce new publications in their field
      of interest. At different phases of their career trajectory,
      the scientists are engaged in academic and research
      activities in a way that is beneficial to their environment
      and are concerned about their own career evolution and
      progress as well [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib1">1</a>]. The career progression that may include the
      academic promotion or obtaining the research grants requires
      a stable and non-interruptive stream of publications. It can
      be achieved with the help of sound contributions to an
      established research plan. A persistent research profile help
      scholars to remain constructive but perhaps it weakens the
      likelihood of originality [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib2">2</a>]. Pioneering perceptions usually arise from
      encountering new challenges and attempting new topics or
      integrating them with existing research agenda. The
      researchers may try to explore new challenges in an urge of
      progress and evolution of a career. Apart from that, the
      nature of across discipline collaborations has made the
      change in the field of interest unavoidable phenomena in
      career trajectory of many scholars.</p>
      <p>Despite its importance on a scientific career,
      productivity, research honorarium and hiring procedures, the
      impact of topic drift in career trajectory of a researcher
      remains unexplored. The researchers can achieve different
      levels of expertise in all their fields of interest. This
      variation in the field of interest can influence the
      performance of the researchers and academicians. The effect
      of this topic drift has not been yet measured in
      literature.</p>
      <p>The primary motivation of the present study is to find the
      impact of the shift of topic on the career of a scholar, as
      several scholars are interested in working in more than one
      topics and some have a tendency to change their topic of
      interest over time. The findings will help those researchers
      who are keen on gaining and maintaining a high standing in
      their scholarly networks by knowing that they shall
      concentrate more on a single topic or attempt to be more
      diverse. Several studies have been conducted to measure the
      impact of researchers. It is known that received citations
      can play a very significant role in measuring the impact of a
      researcher [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#bib3">3</a>],
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib4">4</a>]. Several studies
      have proposed methods for topic-based ranking of authors by
      calculating their impact in all the fields they have worked
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib5">5</a>], [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib6">6</a>]. Various efforts have measured the
      effect of publication venue on the ranking of authors
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib7">7</a>]. In this paper, we
      study the effect of working on multiple topics on the impact
      of authors. For the said purpose, we perform experimentation
      on a dataset retrieved from the field of Information
      Retrieval (IR) and we analyze the progress of authors working
      in single or multiple sub-topics of IR. Learning that a
      researcher can improve the chances of receiving citations by
      working in more than one topic or not can have many cognitive
      benefits. The results of the study show that working on more
      than one topics cannot significantly improve the scientific
      impact of a researcher.</p>

      the problem statement is denoted in section 2; details of
      dataset selection are given in section 3; section 4 describes

        </header>
        <p>From the literature, we have identified a number of
        methods for ranking of authors which consider several
        features as weights. Author Rank algorithm [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib8">8</a>] calculates author significance
        within a co-authorship network considering collaboration
        intensity. Author's impact was quantified by incorporating
        both citation and co-authorship graph property and weighted
        versions of PageRank were presented in [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib9">9</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib10">10</a>]. Six different variants of the
        bibliographic network were studied and compared and as a
        result, the hybrid networks were recommended for studying
        research interactions and collaborations [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib11">11</a>]. While some studies have
        evaluated heterogeneous scholarly networks such as; a
        combination of combining authorship, journal-ship, and
        publication citation networks [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib12">12</a>], citation networks of papers, authors,
        associations and publishing venues [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib13">13</a>], authors, publications, and
        publishing venues along with the effect of the topic
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib5">5</a>] were
        simultaneously considered. The mutual influence of authors
        on each other was studied and it was established that
        ranking of an author is influenced by the standing of their
        co-authors, highly ranked co-authors have more influence on
        junior co-authors and vice versa [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib3">3</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib14">14</a>]–[16]. The effect of collaboration with a
        top-notch researcher on the career of a junior was analyzed
        and significant findings were revealed [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib17">17</a>]. Q-Rank was presented for
        ranking of authors [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib18">18</a>]. It computes the preliminary rank score of
        a researcher depending upon qualities of papers as well as
        the participation of the researcher to those papers. It
        also deals with the situations in which the papers are
        published by only one author.</p>
        <p>The citations based methods, as well as PageRank based
        methods, were used to predict the award-winning researchers
        from approximately two million textual metadata records on
        computer science papers and impact of citations was studied
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib19">19</a>]. Codd Award and
        Turing Award winners were chosen to evaluate the results
        and PageRank based methods perform better when relative
        ranks of awardees were considered.</p>

        <p>The temporal dimension is also an important factor and
        can play an essential role when incorporated as a ranking
        criterion [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=

        time aware method was presented that considers the time of
        publication and time of the citation. The method assigned
        weights to the citations by considering that whether and
        when two authors have collaborated with each other
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib21">21</a>]. Time rank
        method considered the time of citations and gives more

        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib22">22</a>]. The method
        showed that timing of recognition of an author is

        <p>Topic-based methods were used to identify researchers
        with given expertise for different time periods [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib25">25</a>]. Some topic
        based methods have been proposed [<a class="bib"

        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib27">27</a>] yet these variants do not consider the
        heterogeneity of an academic system. In a scientific
        domain, the problem of topic evolution was studied for
        finding key domain advancements and for assisting the
        knowledge transfer within and across domains. It was
        identified that the growth of the main topic normally
        trails a pattern from adjusting status to mature status in
        an evolving process [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib28">28</a>]. Analysis of diffusion of topics was
        studied recently for a weighted citation network and a
        framework for detection of topic evolution was presented
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib29">29</a>].</p>
        <p>A topical inheritance model, between cited and citing
        papers, was used to study the strength of citation
        influence and identification of paper topics. However,
        these methods that involve the impact of topic for ranking
        of authors along with some other criterion do not measure
        the impact of the change of topic by a researcher during
        the research career. A recent study has performed a large
        scale analysis on the bibliographic dataset and it was
        found that changes in research interest follow a
        reproducible pattern in form of exponential distribution
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib30">30</a>]. In a
        quantitative way nature of changes in research interest of

          METHODOLOGY</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>For the current study, we need to classify authors into
      two main categories, i.e., (1) authors working in the single
      topic and (2) authors working on multiple topics. The brief
      methodology is given in Figure <a class="fig" href=
      "#fig1">1</a>. For analysis, we only consider the
      publications that receive one or more citations. We have
      calculated the cumulative number of citations for all the
      publications made by the author as a performance parameter.
      The analysis was based on results extracted in five different
      phases. First of all, extraction and classification of
      authors according to their topics was performed. In this
      phase, single topic authors (STA) and multiple topic authors
      (MTA) were separated by using ACT model [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib31">31</a>]. It considers the probability
      distribution of all authors over extracted topics (i.e., the
      probability of a topic for a given author: P (t|a)). The
      author's probability distribution for a given topic was
      calculated by model (i.e., P (a|t) =P (a) P (t|a)/P (t)). ACT
      model calculated the probability distribution of author and
      topic simultaneously:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li label="•">The probability of a topic for a given author
        P(t|a) which infers research interest of the given author,
        the probability of an author for a given topic P(a|t) which
        can derive the most productive authors for the given
        topic;<br /></li>
        <li label="•">The probability of a topic for a given
        document P(t|d) which infers the topic distribution of the
        given document, the probability of a document for a given
        topic P(d|t) which can derive the most related papers to
        the given topic<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>

        </div>
      </figure>
      <p>Using ACT model we calculated the probability of a topic
      for a given author and the probability of a topic for a given
      document. In the second phase, the preprocessing of data was
      performed. The authors who work on one topic or on multiple
      topics were identified after initial preprocessing. It was
      obtained by scanning of topic probabilities of all authors in
      ten different topics from IR. First, we find out the highest
      value of topic for an author. Out of all ten topics if there
      exists only one highest value then it shows that the author
      is working only on one topic and we have categorized it as
      STA. If an author has higher values for more than one topic
      that means that this author is working on more than one
      topics and we categorize them as MTAs. We also identified the
      topics in which these authors are working. In the next phase,
      publication count of authors with respect to the topic was
      calculated in which publications of STAs and MTAs were
      calculated and stored in the descending order. Similarly,
      citations count of authors with respect to the topic were
      also calculated and stored for both types of authors.
      Finally, we extracted the h-index for the authors from the
      AMiner website [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib32">32</a>]. By the end of this process, we came up with
      two lists of authors, who worked in a single topic and who
      worked in multiple topics along with their number of
      publications, citations, and h-index. Table <a class="tbl"
      href="#tb1">1</a> represents the pseudocode followed for
      obtaining the desired data regarding authors.</p>

      </header>
      <p>In this section, we briefly discuss the results obtained
      for authors working in single topic and authors working in
      multiple topics individually and then we compare them to
      conclude our work. Table <a class="tbl" href="#tb2">2</a>
      shows the representative words of ten topics identified by
      the ACT. First of all, we have arranged the authors with
      respect to their decreasing citations count for both topics
      and compare both types of authors. Figure <a class="fig"
      href="#fig2">2</a> represents the comparison of citation
      count between MTAs and STAs. First five authors of both
      categories have the same citation count (106). However,
      amongst authors from 6-11, it was found that STAs have a
      greater number of citations as compared to MTAs. Overall, the
      total citations across top 15 STAs and MTAs are 840 and 763
      respectively indicating that STAs receive more citations as
      compared to MTAs. On average, top 15 authors of single and
      multiple topics receive 56 and 50 citations respectively. The
      trend line shows that higher trend was obtained by the STAs
      as compared to MTAs. Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>
      compares the publication count of the authors working on
      single topic and authors working on multiple topics. It is
      generally assumed that people working on multiple topics can
      produce more publications as they are more diverse and can
      gain attention from more diverse people. In Figure <a class=
      "fig" href="#fig3">3</a>, we arranged the authors with
      respect to their decreasing number of publications. It
      depicts that authors working on the single topic were able to
      produce more publications as compared to authors working on
      multiple topics. Thus showing that focusing on a single topic
      can result in more publications.</p>

      <p>Moreover, the total number of publications by top 15
      authors working on single topics is 358, whereas, the total
      number of publication by top 15 authors working on multiple
      topics is 307. This finding is not in alliance with the
      general assumption, that is, one can produce more
      publications by working on more topics instead of focusing on
      a single topic. The trend line clearly shows that STAs were
      more productive as compared to MTAs. The linear trend lines
      of citations count and publication count both show a similar
      pattern depicting seniority of authors working in the single
      topic over the authors working in multiple topics.</p>
      <p>The values of publication count and citation count are
      dependent upon the publications present in our selected
      dataset and hence are limited to the size of the dataset.</p>
      <p>In literature, the citations are considered as a parameter
      for measuring the performance of the authors. To cross-check
      the validity of the trend found from the dataset, we have
      taken the top 15 most cited authors along with their number
      of publications, and we have taken their h-index values from
      the AMiner<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>website. Unlike the citations and
      publications count, the h-index values gathered from AMiner
      are not dependent on the statistics of the dataset and hence
      they give a wider picture of the standing of authors. Table
      <a class="tbl" href="#tb3">3</a> shows the top 15 most cited
      STAs and we can see their h-index and publications.
      Similarly, Table <a class="tbl" href="#tb4">4</a> shows the
      top 15 most cited MTAs along with their h-index and
      publications. For both cases, we took fifteen authors who are
      sorted on the basis of their decreasing citation count (there
      are 5 authors in a dataset with highest citation count).
      These tables show that for the majority of authors, with an
      increase in publication count, the h-index is also
      increasing. It is noticed that top 15 authors of both
      categories with the almost similar number of publications
      have very distant values for h-index, while the highest value
      of h-index was achieved by an author of the single topic
      category. Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> plots the
      publications from the dataset for the top 15 most cited
      authors from both topics. The trend that can be seen in this
      figure is also in accordance that was identified from Figure
      <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>. Moreover, the total number
      of publications by top 15 STAs (with respect to citations
      count) is 92, whereas, the total number of publication by top
      15 MTAs (with respect to citations count) is 62 which is a
      big difference between the two types of authors. Figure
      <a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a> shows that the trend of
      h-index found from AMiner is also going in accordance with
      the results obtained from the dataset under consideration and
      it further affirms our results. Just like Figure 4, the
      h-index values are for the top 15 highly cited authors for
      both topics. Thus it can be stated that working on multiple
      topics do not guarantee that the researchers will be able to
      produce more publications and can gain more attention from
      the scientific community via citations. Giving more attention
      and focusing a single topic can be a reason for a modest
      increase in scientific performance.</p>

          FUTURE WORK</h2>

      <p>Authors have a tendency to change their topic of interest
      over time or they may work on multiple topics at the same
      time. Researchers may not usually be an expert in all the
      fields they are interested in. They can be a top-notch
      researcher in one topic and a mediocre in another topic at
      the same time. In this study, we find the effect of change of
      topic and working on multiple topics on the ranking of
      authors. From the trends shown in the figures in results and
      discussion section, we find that authors who work on a single
      topic tend to be more productive and they have a high
      publication count, a high citation count, and a greater
      h-index value. While the authors who work on multiple topics
      have comparatively less number of publications, citations,
      and h-index.</p>
      <p>For dataset selection, we limited the field of interest to
      information retrieval. As a result of this dataset selection
      activity, the findings are biased towards scientists working
      in one or multiple subfields of IR. Yet, this limitation also
      indicates towards new openings for further explorations. In
      fact, more wide-ranging datasets can provide new and richer
      understandings towards the impact of topic drift across
      different disciplines. Further investigations regarding the
      impact of topic drift across more generic specialties should
      also be discovered as it could uncover more significant
      results. Taken together our results offer the first
      systematic empirical evidence on how topic drift affect
      scientific performance and impact.</p>
