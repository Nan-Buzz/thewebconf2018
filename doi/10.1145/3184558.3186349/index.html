        <p><small>Recommending proper experts to knowledge buyers
        is a significant problem in online paid Q&amp;A community
        (OPQC). Existing approaches for online expert
        recommendation have been mainly focused on exploiting
        semantic similarities and social network influence, while
        personalizing recommendation according to individuals’
        motivations has not received much attention. In this paper,
        we propose a personalized expert recommender system, which
        integrates buyer's motivation for knowledge, social
        influence, and money in a unified framework. As an
        innovative application of cognitive computing, our
        recommender system is capable of providing users with the
        best matching experts so as to help them make the most
        cost-effective choice in OPQC. To this end, <em>Paragraph
        Vector</em> technique is implemented to construct domain
        knowledge base (KB) in a multilayer information retrieval
        (IR) framework. Then we perform knowledge pricing based on
        buyer's query and bid in the context of bilateral monopoly
        knowledge market. After that, a Markov Chain based method
        with user motivation learning is introduced to find the
        best matching experts. Finally, we evaluate the proposed
        approach using datasets collected from two OPQC. The
        experimental results show encouraging success as
        effectively offering reasonable personalization options. As
        an innovative approach to solve the expert matching problem
        in OPQC, this research provides flexibility in customizing
        the recommendation heuristics based on user motivation, and
        demonstrate its contribution to a higher rate of optimal
        knowledge seller-buyer matching.</small></p>

          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In the era of knowledge economy and open innovation,
      besides organizational internal knowledge, knowledge outside
      the organization is also considered as an important resource
      to enhance the organizational competitiveness and innovation
      ability [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#bib1">1</a>]. More and
      more attention has been paid to the acquisition of knowledge
      from the external knowledge market [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib2">2</a>]. A marketplace for knowledge is an
      environment in which buyers and sellers trade their personal
      knowledge, according to the prescribed price and transaction
      pattern [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#bib3">3</a>], such as
      Online Paid Q&amp;A community (OPQC). Regarding knowledge as
      a commodity, OPQC is a price-based online knowledge market,
      where buyers seek knowledge providers who match their needs
      and invite them to provide paid question-answering services.
      OPQC is conducive to solving the knowledge sharing dilemma.
      Most of all, the imbalance between low benefits and high
      knowledge sharing costs is regulated by the income of paid
      Q&amp;A services.</p>
      <p>In particular, with the help of information technology,
      the online knowledge markets have been proven to play a
      significant role in promoting knowledge sharing and knowledge
      dissemination [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib4">4</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib5">5</a>]. First, transactions bring economic incentives
      to online knowledge providers. And according to the social
      loafing theory, reputation, word-of-mouth and knowledge
      quality, provided by the electronic market, enhance knowledge
      sharing visibility and alleviate reluctance to share
      knowledge [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#bib6">6</a>]. Second,
      information technology provides support for resource search
      and supply-demand matching in the online knowledge market,
      which eliminate the information asymmetry between the two
      sides of knowledge transactions, and improve the efficiency
      of knowledge dissemination [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib7">7</a>].</p>
      <p>In addition to passive knowledge discovery, recommendation
      mechanism is of vital importance to the knowledge markets
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib8">8</a>]. As recommendation,
      according to the user's preferences and needs, has been
      proved to have a significantly positive influence on users’
      satisfaction [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib9">9</a>]. However, expert recommendation in OPQC is an
      extremely complex task, which requires not only consider the
      knowledge-based recommendations but also the impact of
      motivation and cognitive factors in the process of knowledge
      transaction.</p>
      <p>Knowledge buyers' demand for Q&amp;A services is usually
      due to lacks of domain knowledge or knowledge repository
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib10">10</a>]. This indicates
      that knowledge buyers are most likely to be unfamiliar with
      the fields of their inquiry. For that reason, it is hard for
      a knowledge buyer to accurately find the most appropriate
      knowledge seller, who can satisfy their personalized demands
      for knowledge. What's more, the explosive growth of
      information and the complexity of the knowledge
      classification in yellow pages make it even more difficult to
      conduct efficient search for Q&amp;A expert [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib8">8</a>]. Therefore, a knowledge-based
      recommender system on the basis of experts’ domain knowledge
      and the context of users’ questions is critical to OPQC.
      Moreover, pricing mechanism is one of the most important
      motivators of knowledge transactions in OPQC. Excessive
      prices of Q&amp;A service will reduce the number of knowledge
      transactions and result in an inactive level of knowledge
      interaction. Meanwhile, a service price below cost, failing
      to satisfy knowledge suppliers’ expectations, will depress
      their willingness to participate in knowledge
      transactions.</p>

        <p>In natural language processing, document embedding, also

        and queries with low-dimensional real valued vectors. In a

        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib13">13</a>], given a corpus D of text documents
        available for training, each document in the space is
        represented by a vector <span class=

        {{d_{i,1}},{d_{i,2}}, \ldots ,{d_{i,K}}} )$</span></span> ,
        representing the weighted annotations of knowledge concepts
        in the document. The semantic similarity of two texts can
        then be calculated as the cosine measure of two centroid
        vectors [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=

        <p>Previous architectures for estimating continuous

        </header>
        <p>In this paper, we assume that we have a set of M experts
        in knowledge community: E = {<span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">${e_1},{e_2}, \ldots
        ,{e_M}$</span></span> }. For each expert
        <em>e<sub>i</sub></em> , we have his/her knowledge profile
        represented by a set of Q&amp;A records<span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">${\rm{\;}}{r_i}{\rm{\;}} = {\rm{\;}}(
        {{r_{i,1}},{r_{i,2}} \ldots ,{r_{i,{L_n}}}{\rm{\;}}}
        )$</span></span> , L<sub>n</sub> being the maximum number
        of questions corresponding to one expert. In OPQC, the
        answer is hidden from users except the ones who paid for
        it, and therefore to train an expert's knowledge profile,
        we represent each Q&amp;A record <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">${r_{i,j}}$</span></span> , <em>j</em>=1,2, …,
        L<sub>n</sub>, by a tuple <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">${r_{i,j}} = (
        {{w_{i,j}},{a_{i,j}}} )$</span></span> , where<span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">${\rm{\;}}{w_{i,j}}$</span></span> is the vectorized
        description of question <em>j</em> after document
        embedding, and <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">${a_{i,j}}$</span></span> represents the quality of
        the answer according to users’ feedback. We believe that
        higher answer quality leads to more positive feedback in
        OPQC. Therefore, a larger value of <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">${a_{i,j}}$</span></span> indicates better expertise
        of the field related.</p>
        <p>After extracting question text to knowledge concepts, we
        perform transformation on the quality matrix to express
        domain expertise in a formal and processable way:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="eqn2">
          <div class="display-equation">

            <span class="equation-number">(2)</span>
          </div>
        </div>as a result, <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">${e_{i,k}}$</span></span> ∈ [0,1] measures the
        expertise intensity of expert <span class=

        <p>With the knowledge representation method introduced
        above, we use are trieval model that works in two phase to
        perform query encoding. In the first phase, a new query is
        issued by knowledge buyers describing user's knowledge
        demand, and then projected to vector space as
        <strong><em>q<sub>d</sub></em></strong> . The second phase
        is similar to that in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib20">20</a>], where the query is processed against the
        KB using an inferencing mechanism, returning a set of
        knowledge concepts <strong><em>q<sub>c</sub></em></strong>
        . After encoding, the similarity of a query with an
        expert's domain knowledge can then be computed by cosine
        measure in (1).</p>
        <p>To cope with the case of incomplete KB [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib21">21</a>] (i.e. the corresponding concept
        instances of query are missing in the knowledge source, and
        therefore pure knowledge-based similarity measure can
        perform poorly), we combine the domain concept similarity
        with text semantic similarity to perform complex expertise
        measuring, as in our experiment text semantic similarity
        could perform better in this case.</p>
        <p>Thus, given the historical Q&amp;A records of an expert,
        when a new query <strong><em>q</em></strong> checks in, an
        expert's domain knowledge intensity on the field related
        can be inferred as:</p>

      <p>Knowledge buyers have multiple motivations when seeking
      knowledge service in OPQC. In order to better serve users
      with different types of demand, our system implements diverse
      approaches to expert recommendation with pre-designed
      motivation models. In this section, we define three types of
      motivation model based on widely-accepted theories. Firstly,
      knowledge profit is put forward based on self-interest
      theory, in considering the cost-benefit analysis made by
      knowledge buyers, together with the influence of knowledge
      depreciation creatively adopted [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib24">24</a>]. Secondly, social benefits are proposed from
      the perspective of social capital theory, taking the
      centrality of experts into account [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib25">25</a>]. And finally, the third
      motivation, monetary revenue, is added considering users’
      intention to earn extra income in a special situation called
      “eavesdrop” in OPQC.</p>

            Profits</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>From the perspective of rational man hypothesis,
        knowledge buyers tend to favor the most qualified experts
        with the highest reputation in the related field, in order
        to maximize the expected incoming knowledge value in a
        service. Given that knowledge is sold with price in OPQC,
        we model knowledge profits with pricing factor in this
        subsection, so as to distinguish the most knowledge-worthy
        experts for knowledge buyers.</p>
        <p>We first discuss some market characteristics of OPQC. In
        knowledge transaction market, one piece of knowledge links
        only one seller with one buyer. In other word, knowledge
        service is customized, and therefore both sides have
        extreme bargaining power. Another typical feature of OPQC
        is incomplete information, which means a seller doesn't
        know the actual value of his knowledge for its buyer.
        Similarly, a buyer has little information of the actual
        knowledge cost of the seller. Thus, a seller's bid is
        mainly determined by his estimation of knowledge cost; a
        buyer's bid is mainly determined by his estimation of
        knowledge utility.</p>
        <p>With the features discussed above, we consider knowledge
        transaction market as a new type of bilateral monopoly
        market [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href="#bib22">22</a>], and
        put forward the method of knowledge pricing.</p>
        <p><em>Definition 3.1</em> (<strong>Knowledge
        Cost</strong>) Knowledge cost [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib23">23</a>] is the cost of knowledge seller, which
        mainly refers to the loss of competitiveness after
        knowledge sharing. Although a seller's knowledge cost is
        unknown to its buyer, it can be estimated by his bid
        <em>p<sub>s</sub></em> . In this paper, we adopt the
        uniform distribution to represent knowledge cost as
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${c_i}\sim
        U( {0,{p_s}} )$</span></span> . It follows that:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation}Pr\left(
            {{c_i}} \right) =
            \frac{1}{{p_s^i}}\end{equation}</span><br />
            <span class="equation-number">(4)</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p><em>Definition 3.2</em> (<strong>Knowledge
        Utility</strong>) Knowledge utility [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib23">23</a>] is the value of knowledge to a
        buyer. For the same piece of knowledge, its utility can
        vary from different buyers. In knowledge market, we assume
        that buyers are clear on how much the question values to
        them, since they are the subject of knowledge service.
        Therefore, we believe a buyer's bid <em>p<sub>b</sub></em>
        is presented with careful consideration, which can honestly
        represent the knowledge utility on the buyer. However, the
        quality of the answer is an uncertain factor. A good answer
        can create value far beyond the buyer's expectation, while
        a careless one may have limited utility. In this paper, we
        approximate such uncertainty with a Gaussian distribution
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${u_i}\sim
        $</span></span> <em>N</em> <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$( {{p_b},{\sigma ^2}}
        )$</span></span> . It follows that:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">

            = \frac{1}{{\sqrt {2\pi } {\sigma _i}}}\exp [ -
            \frac{{{{({u_i} - p_b^i)}^2}}}{{\sqrt {2\pi } {\sigma

        </div>where <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

        expert is experienced in query <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\vec

        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${f_i}(
        {\vec q} )$</span></span> , the expected knowledge utility
        becomes more concentrated around buyer's bid.
        <p></p>
        <p><em>Definition 3.3</em> (<strong>Knowledge
        Depreciation</strong>) Knowledge depreciation [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib24">24</a>] is the decline
        of knowledge utility as time goes by, because the
        continuous competition and dissemination of knowledge lower
        the knowledge scarcity.</p>
        <p>Knowledge stored as information has no physical
        depreciation. However, in mass OPQC, knowledge is
        incessantly disseminating and colliding with fierce
        competition driven by price, which causes the decline of
        knowledge scarcity. Online knowledge buyers tend to prefer
        real-time Q&amp;A service, otherwise, they will possibly
        lose favor in online service and alternatively turn to
        other means like books or face-to-face consultation. Under
        this circumstance, knowledge with long delay will be less
        competitive and therefore of less value. Therefore, we
        consider knowledge depreciation as a significant factor
        influencing knowledge pricing in OPQC. In our model, we
        apply an exponential term to represent a buyer's dynamic
        knowledge utility decline with time:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} {u_i}\left( t

            t}},\end{equation}</span><br />
            <span class="equation-number">(6)</span>
          </div>
        </div>where λ is the depreciation coefficient, and
        <em>t</em> refers to the expected answer interval according
        to the expert's online activation.
        <p></p>
        <p>The character of knowledge transaction determines that
        we cannot use marginal cost to perform knowledge pricing
        according to traditional economics. It's argued by
        Chatterjee and Samuelson [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib13">13</a>] that under incomplete information,
        transaction price under <em>Nash Equilibrium</em>is p* ∈
        [c,u]. The transaction surplus <em>u-c</em> will be divided
        by each side. After infinite bargaining, the final
        transaction price will be [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib13">13</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

          </div>
        </div>where <em>δ<sub>s</sub>, δ<sub>b</sub></em> are the
        discount rate of seller and buyer respectively, reflecting
        the patience of each side. <em>δ<sub>s</sub></em> will be
        small when the number of potential competitors is large. As
        more choices for buyers will motivate sellers to become
        more eager to sell their knowledge. Similarly,
        <em>δ<sub>b</sub></em> will be small when the buyer is
        urgent to seek the knowledge to solve his problem.
        <p></p>
        <p>Then, in our model, we compute the transaction surplus
        on buyers to define expected knowledge profits in OPQC:</p>

      Given a set of experts E, a top-k list of ranking with
      respect to E is an ordering of <em>τ<sup>(k)</sup></em> =
      [<em>e<sub>1</sub></em> ≥<em>e<sub>2</sub></em> ≥ …≥
      <em>e<sub>k</sub></em> ], <em>e<sub>i</sub></em> ∈E. Without
      loss of generality, we assume that ≥ denotes descending
      order.</p>
      <p>In our model, let τ<sub>1</sub>, τ<sub>2</sub>
      andτ<sub>3</sub> denote the ranking lists with respect to the
      criterion of optimal knowledge profits, social benefits and
      monetary revenue respectively. We then define our Markov

        </header>
        <p>We evaluate the proposed approach by large-scale real
        data from two OPQCs. Both are highly popular communities
        with active domain experts and knowledge buyers creating
        thousands of knowledge transactions per day. The operating
        modes of two platforms are similar. Experts describe their
        fields of expertise and set their own unit price for
        answering each question in their profiles. Meanwhile,
        knowledge buyers send question description to desirable
        experts and then obtain personalized knowledge service
        after paying the price. Answers, in the form of voice, can
        be eavesdropped by other users costing one dollar, which
        goes half and half to reward the original asker and
        answer.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Dataset A</em></strong>. The dataset
        includes 7,227 experts, 4,477 knowledge buyers with 171,534
        transactions. Each transaction record contains the ID of
        seller and buyer, transaction price, #eavesdrop, #like, and
        the question content.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Dataset B</em></strong>. The dataset
        includes 2,663 experts, 542 knowledge buyers with 14,336
        tractions.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that those experts and knowledge
        buyers with less than 5 transaction records were removed in
        both datasets, as the experiment expert's domain knowledge
        and user's motivation will be highly biased with extremely
        limited training data.</p>

        <p>In our experiment, we randomly select 10 knowledge
        buyers from datasets. For each knowledge buyer, the first
        80% Q&amp;A records are used as training data, and the
        other 20% are used as testing data. We learn the model and
        obtain the top-k recommendation list for the knowledge
        buyer with anew query. To investigate the overall
        performance of the recommender system, we use two
        evaluation metrics including Accuracy@k [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib30">30</a>] and Recall@k.</p>

            <strong><em>Accuracy@k (A@k)</em>.</strong> To evaluate

            adopt the metrics used in [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
            "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"
            href="#bib30">30</a>]. Specifically, for each Q&amp;A

            compute the score of each potential expert and then
            obtain the top-k list of recommendation corresponding
            to the buyer with a new query. If the ground truth
            expert is included in the list, we define it valid
            recommendation, otherwise, it's invalid. Accuracy@k is
            computed by the proportion of valid recommendation in
            the test set:

        <p><strong><em>Recall@k (R@k)</em>.</strong>Recall@k is
        defined to evaluate the ability to discover potential
        target expert. For each knowledge buyer, an expert is
        defined to be potential target only if they once have
        knowledge transaction in the training set, which indicates
        their possibility to become trading partners again when the
        buyer raises new questions. Similarly, after obtaining the
        top-k list for each test case, we compute the proportion of
        potential experts in the list of recommendation to evaluate
        the system's ability to recall potential target. The
        overall Recall@k is then computed as the average of all
        test cases:</p>

        <p>In this subsection, we present the experimental
        performance of our recommender system on our datasets,
        respectively. Since the idea of OPQC has lately arisen and
        attracted little attention, we are short of baselines for
        comparison in our experiment. However, our results can be
        considered as exploring work for future comparison and
        improvement.</p>
        <p><a class="fig" href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>, <a class="fig"
        href="#fig6">6</a> report the A@k and R@k result on two
        datasets, where k is 1, 5, and 10. The overall accuracy is
        satisfying, with an average A@10 of 0.358 for dataset A and
        0.380 for dataset B, which means that in more than one
        third of all test cases, the actual expert selected by the
        user is precisely located and recommended in the top-10
        list. It demonstrates that our recommender system can
        effectively capture user's motivation, find the matching
        experts and then generate reasonable recommendations in
        OPQC.</p>

        <p>It is also observed that the recall performance varies
        greatly among users. The recall rate is generally higher
        for those users with a single strong motivation in the past
        buying behavior, which can be as high as 0.8 (see Fig
        <a class="fig" href="#fig6">6b</a>). For other users with
        relatively “balanced” motivation, our system shows
        conserved performance in discovering potential target
        expert.</p>
        <p><a class="fig" href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> provides an
        intuitive visualization of the motivation parameter θ of
        askers selected in dataset A. According to the figure, the
        motivation for knowledge transaction in OPQC indeed differs
        among difference askers as we suppose earlier. It shows
        that some askers appear to be pure knowledge seekers always
        looking for the most professional experts; while some are
        clearly active money makers who pay his effort in targeting
        the most profitable experts before asking. Therefore, pure
        knowledge matching or network relations oriented methods
        cannot provide accurate recommendations in this case.</p>

        <p>In the experiment, we consider the actual respondent
        expert selected by knowledge buyers as the ground truth.
        However, since users have limited view in reality, their
        choice may not actually be the optimal choice. Therefore,
        given the inborn limitation of OPQC user, the significance
        of our research is that it enables users to have easy
        access to their potential perfect match by learning the
        motivation from past behavior. In other word, our
        recommender system provides them with a broader view of
        personalized valuable expert information, and therefore
        contributes to a higher rate of optimal seller-buyer
        matching.</p>
        <p>Another noteworthy finding is that the system
        performance might not keep increasing with more training
        examples. As shown in <a class="fig" href="#fig8">Fig.
        8</a>, the overall performance initially goes up with
        increasing number of training examples as the system better
        captures user's motivation, but it drops significantly
        after the training set gets too large. We believe the
        reason is that in our model, for simplicity, we consider
        user motivation as rather static variables. In other word,
        we assume that a knowledge buyer who values knowledge
        profit the most would always look for the most qualified
        expert. However, user's interest and motivation for seeking
        knowledge are changing dynamically in reality. In this
        case, static modeling has its limitation in recommendation
        performance as it may overfit large training set.</p>

      <p>In this research, an expert recommendation in OPQC is
      proposed, adopting cognitive mechanisms (e.g. social capital
      theory) to heighten computational intelligence. This
      personalized expert recommender system, under the
      consideration of multi-cognitive factors, is an early
      comprehensive framework to address the demand-supply matching
      problem in OPQC. The results of the experiment demonstrate
      that the proposed model is capable of generating reasonable
      recommendations, consistent with the motivation behind
      knowledge transaction behavior. Therefore, theoretical
      contributions of this research can be affirmed.</p>
      <p>At the same time, this research, as an application of
      cognitive computing, also has certain practical value.
      Because with the help of our intelligent expert
      recommendation system, the continuous adoption of the
      community will be enhanced. Firstly, for a newly developing
      Q&amp;A community, such as OPQC, both the quality and the
      quantity of knowledge are essential to the platform. Our new
      expert recommendation system can increase the visibility of
      domain experts’ knowledge sharing behaviors. Thus, knowledge
      sharing dilemma caused by social loafing will be alleviated,
      and the quality of the Q&amp;A service will be improved on
      the whole platform. Secondly, high reflection speed and
      Q&amp;A service quality will raise the perceived usefulness
      of knowledge buyers’ online learning experience. And thirdly,
      taking knowledge pricing into consideration can help
      knowledge buyers making the most cost-effective choice in
      finding domain experts, therefore enhance satisfaction of
      community users.</p>
      <p>For the ongoing and future work, improvement on the
      accuracy of recommendation results can be developed, with
      larger and richer datasets. At the same time, the problem of
      overfitting large-scale data needs to be noticed. To solve
      that problem, dynamic modeling can be adopted to capture the
      dynamic variation of user interest and preference, so as to
      increase the overall accuracy of recommendation.</p>
