        <p><small>Over the past few years, ride-sharing has been
        proven to be an effective way to relieve urban traffic
        congestion, as evidenced by several emerging ride-sharing
        platforms such as Uber and Didi. A key economic problem for
        these platforms is to design a revenue-optimal (or
        welfare-optimal) pricing scheme and a corresponding vehicle
        dispatching policy that incorporates geographic
        information, and more importantly, dynamic supply and
        demand. In this paper, we aim to solve this problem by
        introducing a unified model that takes into account both
        travel time and driver redirection. We tackle the
        non-convexity problem using the “ironing” technique and
        formulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision
        process (MDP), where the states are the driver
        distributions and the decision variables are the prices.
        Our main finding is to give an efficient algorithm that
        computes the exact revenue (or welfare) optimal randomized
        pricing schemes. We characterize the optimal solutions of
        the MDP by primal-dual analysis of a convex program. We
        also conduct empirical analysis of our solution with real
        data of a major ride-sharing platform and show its
        significant advantages over fixed pricing schemes as well
        as those prevalent surge-based pricing schemes.</small></p>

      <p>The emerging applications of shared mobility, such as
      ride-sharing, bike-sharing, and car-sharing, have been proven
      to be an effective way to utilize transportation resources
      and to improve social welfare&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]. Over the past few years,
      intensive researches have been done on topics related to the
      economic aspects of sharing mobility&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>].</p>
      <p>Despite of existing literatures, the problems of how to
      design revenue optimal (or welfare optimal) prices and
      dispatching schemes in these environments, to the best of our
      knowledge, are still not well understood. There are at least
      two challenges when one wants to tackle this problem. First
      of all, due to the nature of transportation, the pricing and
      dispatching scheme must be geographically dependent.
      Secondly, the pricing and dispatching scheme should take into
      consideration the fact that the supply and the demand in
      these environments may change over time. As a result, it may
      be difficult to compute, or even to represent a price and
      dispatching scheme for such complex environments.</p>
      <p>Traditional pricing and dispatching schemes for taxis
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class=

      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>] do not
      capture the dynamic nature of the environments under
      consideration in this paper: (i) the dispatching system for
      these shared vehicles can make use of dynamic pricing to
      further boost revenue, while taxi fees calculated by
      traditional schemes are based on a fixed function of
      traveling distance and time; (ii) the prices of flight
      tickets are sold via relatively long booking periods, in
      contrast, the customers of shared vehicles make their
      decisions rather immediately.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>In this paper, we propose a graph based model to analyze
        the vehicle dispatching and pricing problem mentioned
        above. In the graph, each node refers to a region in the
        city and each edge refers to a possible trip that includes
        a pair of origin and destination as well as a cost
        associated with the trip on this edge.</p>
        <p>The design problem is, for the platform, to set a price
        for each edge at each time step as well as the vehicle
        dispatches induced by the supply and demand at the origin
        of that edge under this price at this time. The objective
        of the platform can either be its revenue or the social
        welfare or any convex combination between them.</p>

            Techniques</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Our model naturally induces a <em>Markov Decision
        Process</em> (MDP) with the driver distributions on each
        node as states, the throughputs along each edge as actions,
        and the objective (e.g., revenue or welfare) as the
        rewards. While it is in general PSPACE-hard to solve MDPs,
        we come up with an efficient (polytime) algorithm that
        finds the <em>exact optimal solution</em>.</p>
        <p>Our first key step that makes the MDP trackable is to
        formulate the task as a dispatching problem instead of
        simply a pricing problem. We then translate the demand
        functions along each edge into throughput-reward tradeoffs
        (i.e., the maximum reward can be achieved along this edge
        with fixed throughput), and then formulate the problem as
        an optimization with throughputs (along each edge at edge
        time slot) as variables.</p>
        <p>In our algorithm, we overcome two major difficulties:
        (i) we first reduce the throughput-reward tradeoff, which
        in general is not concave, to its convex hull by allowing
        for randomized pricing schemes (commonly adopted in
        mechanism design and easy to implement in practice), and
        (ii) then we solve the MDP with continuous state by
        formulating it as a convex program. In particular, all the
        constraints in the convex program are linear.</p>
        <p>We emphasize that changing the perspective from pricing
        to dispatching is critical to enable the global
        optimization for this problem instead of using local
        optimization (such as surge pricing) only. Although our
        approach is quite different from the industry, it can be
        easily adopted in practice. We discuss such advantages of
        our approach in details in the full version of this paper

        <p>As the environment varies over time in practice, we
        allow the traveling cost, the valuation and demand of the
        customers along each edge to be different at each time
        period. Despite of the high complexity of the dynamics in
        such an environment, we are able to reduce any general
        instance to a simplified and restricted instance and the
        optimal solution of the general instance can be easily
        recovered from the optimal solution of the simplified
        instance.</p>

            Contribution</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>In this paper, we introduce a simple model for the
        dispatching problem that can be used for a wide range of
        general settings (see the full version for detailed
        discussions on the general settings and how they can be
        reduced to our simple model [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]). Dynamic environments, as one of
        the general settings, commonly exist in practice [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>], where
        the prior information (e.g., frequency and values of
        requests, the traveling costs) may be different for each
        time period. Such dynamic environments pose additional
        challenges to the pricing and dispatching problem. To the
        best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate such
        dynamics into a unified model.</p>
        <p>With such a model, we then formalize the problem as a
        mathematical program with linear constraints by introducing
        the throughput-reward tradeoffs. Although in general the
        program is not convex, we convexify it by introducing
        randomized prices and hence the optimal solution can be
        computed efficiently. One major merit of this approach is
        that one can easily introduce additional constraints to the
        problem with few change to the algorithm. For example, in
        practice, the supply might be asymmetric and correlated
        over time and the platform may want the distribution of the
        supply to be stationary in long run.</p>
        <p>We also provide a characterization of the optimal
        solution via primal-dual analysis. In particular, a dynamic
        pricing scheme is optimal if and only if the marginal
        contribution of the throughput along each edge equals to
        the system-wise marginal contribution of additional supply
        minus the difference of the long term contributions of unit
        supply at the origin and the destination.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Finally, we perform extensive empirical analysis based
        on a publicly available dataset with more than 8.5 million
        orders. We use revenue of the platform as our objective and
        compare our policy with the fixed pricing policy and the
        surge pricing policy which is intensively studied in the
        literature [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. We perform simulations in both
        static and dynamic environments.</p>
        <p>Our simulation results show that, in the static
        environment, our optimal pricing scheme outperforms the
        fixed pricing and surge pricing policies by about 24% and
        17%, respectively. In the dynamic environment, our optimal
        pricing scheme outperforms the other two policies by about
        33%, 60%, respectively.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, our simulations show that our optimal
        policy has much stronger ability in dispatching vehicles
        and balancing the supply and demand across the entire
        system than other policies, which results directly in its
        performance boost.</p>
