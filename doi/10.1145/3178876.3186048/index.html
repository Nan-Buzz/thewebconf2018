Such crowdsourcing contests have become prevalent in the web economy: Kaggle competitions, user-generated content, and Topcoder are all examples of crowdsourced contests. As the host&#x0027;s objective usually depends on the quality of the contributions, an obvious question arises: how to design contests that spur the greatest innovation among potential contributors. While a problem of this nature was first posed by Francis Galton in 1902, the prevalence of contests on the web has inspired more recent work at the intersection of computer science and economics addressing the design of optimal contests [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>].</p>    <p>Starting from a seminal work in the economics literature [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>], typical models of contest design formulate a game in which a prize is to be distributed to players based on the quality of their contributions. Their level of quality is a strategic decision, and the players incur costs (in the form of requisite effort) that depend on this choice. Players also have private abilities, which offset their costs: i.e., more talented players can produce contributions of the same quality with less effort. The goal of each player, then, is to maximize their share of the prize by making a worthy contribution, while simultaneously minimizing their efforts/costs; their utility is the difference between these two quantities.</p>    <p>Much of the existing work on optimal contest design assumes either that players have essentially the same ability<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>], or that cost is a linear function of the quality of a contribution [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. <a class="fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, the effort required to construct a high quality contribution naturally increases in a nonlinear fashion. It is easy to design a cookie-cutter solution; it is much harder to produce an original design. In other words, effort is often characterized by (significantly) diminishing returns. The famous 80/20 rule, which states that &#x201C;20% of the work gets you 80% of the way there,&#x201D; captures this nonlinearity. The difficulty in addressing contest design with both nonlinear costs and players of heterogeneous ability hinges on the fact that the combination of these two elements equates the contest design problem to that of mechanism design with non quasi-linear utility functions. Hence, unlike the case of linear costs (and quasi-linear utilities), standard results from Myerson&#x0027;s theory of optimal mechanism design [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>] are not fully available.</p>    <p>In this work, we address optimal contest design with convex costs (and hence, concave utilities) and heterogeneous player abilities drawn from some prior distribution. Moreover, following the recent literature on prior-free mechanism design [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>], our goal is to design simple approximately-optimal contests that are independent of the details of the setting, which in our case means the details of the prior distribution, or of the cost function.</p>    <p>We work with the general model presented in the classic work of Moldovanu and Sela [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>]. The goal of the designer is to maximize the sum of the qualities of the players&#x2019; contributions, assuming the players incur a cost for contributing <em>p</em> of the form <em>c</em>(<em>p</em>)/<em>v</em>, where <em>v</em> is an ability, and <em>c</em> is a convex function. If a player wins prize <em>x</em>, then their overall utility is <em>u</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>p</em>; <em>v</em>) = <em>x</em> &#x2212; <em>c</em>(<em>p</em>)/<em>v</em>. Despite defining this general model, [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>] obtain optimality or near-optimality results only in the case of linear costs. For convex costs, they analyze mechanisms that can distribute the prize to at most two contributors, in which case they state conditions under which allocating only to top contributors (i.e., &#x201C;winner-takes-all&#x201D;) is optimal. However, for convex costs, winner-takes-all allocations can be very suboptimal. <a class="fn" href="#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>    </p>    <p>    <em>Summary of Results.</em>. Our main result is to show that a simple contest that distributes the prize equally among the top quartile of contributors achieves a constant-factor approximation of the optimal, for a large class of distributions of abilities (bounded Monotone-Hazard-Rate distributions), and for the class of convex cost functions of the form <em>c</em>(<em>p</em>) = <em>p<sup>d</sup>    </em>, where <em>d</em> &#x2265; 2 is a measure of convexity, when the number of contributors is larger than some constant.</p>    <p>Our results are enabled by a simulation theorem (which holds for <em>all</em> convex cost functions) whereby the interim outcome of a direct mechanism&#x2014;where the designer elicits the players&#x2019; private abilities, and then decides (on their behalf) how much each should contribute and how much each will be allocated&#x2014;can be implemented as the Bayes-Nash equilibrium (BNE) of a contest, where the players choose their own contribution qualities. This simulation theorem, together with the revelation principle, establishes an equivalence between optimal mechanism design and optimal contest design. There are two main implications of this equivalence:</p>    <ol class="list-no-style">    <li id="list1" label="(1)">It points to the difficulty of optimal contest design with convex costs, as it is an instance of optimal mechanism design with non quasi-linear utilities. Consequently, although our main results hinge on a specific form of monomial cost functions (<em>c</em>(<em>p</em>) = <em>p<sup>d</sup>     </em>), the difficulty of taking even this small step should be apparent.<br/></li>    <li id="list2" label="(2)">It shows that restricting to contests does not require that a designer accept any sacrifice in performance (assuming they are willing to accept BNE implementation). Even if the designer were to try to devise some more complex mechanism, any such mechanism is implementable by a direct mechanism by the revelation principle, and any direct mechanism is implementable as a BNE of a contest by our simulation theorem. Hence, the total transfers (however they are interpreted: e.g., revenue, contributions, etc.) of any indirect mechanism are achievable at a BNE of some contest.<br/></li>    </ol>    <p>Given this simulation theorem, it suffices to focus on direct mechanisms, which we do, using the language of contests (i.e., ability, for value, and contribution, for payment). As already noted, Myerson&#x0027;s theory of optimal mechanism design is not fully applicable in our convex cost model. Hence, we begin by deriving an upper bound on the total contributions achievable by any direct mechanism. Subsequently, we analyze a simple class of threshold mechanisms, where the prize is equally divided among all contributors whose ability surpasses some threshold. We show that very simple thresholds, including the median of the ability distribution as well as a randomly sampled ability, achieve a constant-factor approximation to our upper bound on the optimal, and hence the optimal.</p>    <p>We then show that when the number of contributors is larger than a constant,<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id="foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> an approximately-optimal threshold mechanism can be well approximated (at the loss of an extra constant factor) by a contest that awards the prize to a carefully chosen top fraction of contributors. For instance, awarding the top half of contributors is similar to the threshold mechanism that awards all contributors whose ability is above the median; likewise, for other quantiles of the ability distribution. This observation allows us to establish our main result: awarding the top quartile of contributors is a constant-factor approximation to the optimal contest. We note, once again, that the flavor of this result is quite different from that of the linear-cost model, where a winner-takes-all design is optimal. When costs are convex, it is better to incentivize additional effort from multiple contributors, rather than only from those of greatest ability.</p>    <p>We conclude by evaluating the performance of the proposed contests via simulation experiments. We show that the top-quartile contest, and other more refined contests whose thresholds depend on the degree of convexity of the cost function, perform significantly better on average than the worst-case bounds of our theorems.</p>    <p>Our results have implications for revenue maximization with non quasi-linear utilities [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]. One implication is a prior-free approximately-optimal mechanism, assuming our form of utility functions, which could be of independent interest in the literature engendered by Myerson on optimal auction design.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-5">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> All-Pay Contest Model</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>We consider a contest model, which we dub an &#x201C;all-pay&#x201D; contest model, because it can be understood as an all-pay reverse auction. In this model, a contest designer has one unit of prize money to award to a set of <em>n</em> contributors/players. Each player <em>i</em> &#x2208; <em>N</em> = {1, &#x2026;, <em>n</em>} has a private <strong>ability</strong>     <em>v<sub>i</sub>    </em>, drawn independently from an atomless distribution <em>F</em>, with continuous probability density <em>f</em> that is strictly positive on the support, which is the closed interval <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$T = [0, \bar{v_{}}]$</span>    </span>. We write <strong>v</strong> = (<em>v</em>    <sub>1</sub>, &#x2026;, <em>v<sub>n</sub>    </em>) &#x2208; <em>T<sup>n</sup>    </em> to denote a sample ability vector, drawn from distribution <em>F<sup>n</sup>    </em>.</p>    <p>Conditional on their ability, each player <em>i</em> chooses a quality of <strong>contribution</strong>     <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$b_{i} \in \mathbb {R}^{n}$</span>    </span>, which hereafter we refer to solely as a contribution.

Given a vector of contributions <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathbf {b_{}}_{}= (b_{1}, \ldots , b_{n}) \in \mathbb {R}^{n}$</span>    </span> the designer then chooses an allocation of the prize, <strong>x</strong>(<strong>b</strong>) &#x2208; [0, 1]<sup>     <em>n</em>    </sup>, such that &#x2211;<sub>     <em>i</em> &#x2208; <em>N</em>    </sub>    <strong>x</strong>(<strong>b</strong>) = 1.

We assume each player chooses a contribution so as to maximize their expected utility conditional on their own ability and in expectation over their opponents&#x2019; abilities.

The goal of the contest designer is to design an allocation rule that maximizes total expected contributions at the BNE of the resulting all-pay contest, i.e.: <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathop{\mathbb {E}}_{\mathbf {v_{}}_{}}\left[\sum _{i\in N} b_{i}(v_{i})\right]$</span>    </span>.</p>    <p>    <em>Utility transformation.</em>. For technical reasons, it is convenient to translate the above contest model to a mathematically equivalent one, where players have utilities of the form: <div class="table-responsive" id="eq2">     <div class="display-equation">      <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} u_{i} (b_{i}, \mathbf {b_{}}_{-i}; v_{i}) = v_{i} x_{i} (b_{i}, \mathbf {b_{}}_{-i}) - c_{i} (b_{i}) .\end{equation} </span>      <br/>      <span class="equation-number">(3)</span>     </div>    </div> Since players maximize their utility conditional on their own ability, maximizing the utility in Equation&#x00A0;(<a class="eqn" href="#eq1">1</a>) is equivalent to maximizing the utility in Equation&#x00A0;(<a class="eqn" href="#eq2">3</a>), which differ by the constant factor <em>v<sub>i</sub>    </em>. This latter form of utilities is more convenient because it allows us to interpret the setting in the forward direction, where player <em>i</em> has value (ability) <em>v<sub>i</sub>    </em> per-unit of good (prize) and incurs a cost that is a function of his payment (contribution) <em>b<sub>i</sub>    </em>. We can then make use the extensive toolbox developed in the revenue maximization literature. This utility transformation was similarly used in prior work on contests with linear costs [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>].</p>    <p>    <em>Direct Mechanisms</em>. By the classic revelation principle [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>], an all-pay contest is outcome equivalent (i.e., induces the same allocation of prizes and the same contribution from each player, conditional on their private information&#x2014;that is, their ability) to what is known as a <strong>direct mechanism</strong>. In a direct mechanism, the designer elicits the players&#x2019; private information directly, which in our setting is an ability report <em>w<sub>i</sub>    </em> &#x2208; <em>T</em> from each player <em>i</em>.</p>    <p>Given a vector of reports <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathbf {w}_{}= \left(w_{1}, \dots , w_{n} \right) \in \mathbb {R}^{n}$</span>    </span>, for all <em>i</em> &#x2208; <em>N</em>, a mechanism is defined by an <strong>allocation rule</strong>     <strong>x</strong>(<strong>w</strong>) &#x2208; [0, 1]<sup>     <em>n</em>    </sup>, such that &#x2211;<sub>     <em>i</em> &#x2208; <em>N</em>    </sub>    <em>x<sub>i</sub>    </em>(<strong>w</strong>) = 1, together with a <strong>contribution rule</strong>     <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathbf {p_{}}_{}(\mathbf {w}_{}) \in \mathbb {R}_{\ge 0}^n$</span>    </span>, that specifies the contribution <em>p<sub>i</sub>    </em>(<strong>w</strong>) required of each player <em>i</em>.

The smaller class is that of monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions, which require that <em>h</em>(<em>v</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>v</em>)/(1 &#x2212; <em>F</em>(<em>v</em>)) be monotone non-decreasing. The larger class is that of regular distributions, which require that <em>R</em>(<em>q</em>) be a concave function, or equivalently <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\phi (v_{}(q)) = R^{\prime }(q)= v(q)-\frac{1-F(v(q))}{f(v(q))}$</span>    </span>, be monotone decreasing.

Thus, as the payment functions become more convex, the cost-optimized reserve mechanism converges to full optimality. Moreover, like the median threshold mechanism, the cost-optimized threshold mechanism can also be implemented as the BNE of an all-pay contest with an appropriately chosen contribution threshold (see Appendix <a class="sec" href="#sec-15">A.2</a> for details).</p>    <p>We have seen that simple contests that allocate the prize uniformly to all players who contribute above a certain threshold achieve a constant-factor approximation of the optimal. Although they are detail-free, in the sense that they do not require full distributional knowledge, they require some knowledge of the distribution and/or of the cost function in order to be implemented. In the next section, we will completely remove the dependence on the distribution and the cost function, at the expense of assuming that the number of contributors is larger than some constant.</p>    <p>    <div class="remark" id="enc15">     <Label>Remark 1 (Implications for Revenue Maximization).</Label>     <p> Before we move on to our endeavor for robust optimal contests we remark that the results in this section have implications for the revenue maximization problem with non quasi-linear utilities. In particular, if we replace contributions with payments, then the optimal mechanism design problem for our setting is a revenue maximization problem where players incur costs that are a convex function of their payments. Under this interpretation, Theorem <a class="enc" href="#enc13">5.3</a> implies that allocating uniformly at random to all players whose value is above the median of the value distribution is a constant approximation to the optimal revenue. Using similar techniques, we can also show that rather than choosing the median threshold, choosing as a threshold a value that is drawn randomly from the value distribution also leads to a constant-factor approximation. Notably, this mechanism can be implemented in a completely prior-free manner, where we use one player as a threshold setter, and allocate uniformly at random to all remaining players whose value is above that of the threshold setter. This result is an analogue of the classic result of Bulow and Klemperer [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] for our setting.

We saw that these contests are approximately optimal, but are faced with a difficulty: the appropriate contribution threshold to set, so that it translates to a target quantile threshold (corresponding to a target ability threshold), depends on the exponent <em>d</em>. As a result, it seems unlikely that there exists a universal contribution threshold that would work for all <em>d</em>. A further difficulty stems from the fact that contests in which the allocation depends on the absolute value of the players&#x2019; contributions tend not to have unique equilibria [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>].</p>    <p>Given these issues, we instead investigate allocation functions in which each player&#x0027;s allocation depends only on the rank of their contribution relative to those of the other players. The key idea is that we can try to approximate the median threshold mechanism with such a relative ranking mechanism by allocating uniformly to the top half of the contributors, and nothing to the bottom half. Assuming that players contribute according to a symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium with a strictly monotone increasing contribution function <em>b</em>(&#x00B7;) (which is the unique equilibrium based on the results of [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]), then at equilibrium the contributors whose abilities rank in the top half will be allocated a prize of 2<em>n</em>. <a class="fn" href="#fn5" id="foot-fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> If the number of contributors is at least some constant, then this interim allocation function will strongly resemble the interim allocation function of the median threshold mechanism: contributors with ability strictly above the median, by some error margin &#x03F5;, will be allocated 2<em>n</em> with probability approaching 1, while players whose abilities are strictly below the median, again by some error margin &#x03F5;, will be allocated near 0. These results follow from a concentration of measure inequality argument. Hence, this mechanism will achieve an approximation ratio of the form <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$1 / \alpha - O (\sqrt {\log (n) / n})$</span>    </span>, where <em>&#x03B1;</em> is some small constant, since the median mechanism is approximately optimal.</p>    <p>In order to avoid a dependence in our analysis on a lower bound on the density of the ability distribution, we actually propose a more competitive all-pay contest where we allocate to a smaller fraction of the contributors. In the theorem that follows, we pick the top quarter, but we note that the constants could be further optimized by picking a more involved fraction.

We conclude this paper with an investigation of how well our proposed contests perform empirically, compared to our theoretical guarantees. In particular, we examine the performance of an all-pay contest that distributes the prize uniformly to the top quartile of contributors (Theorem <a class="enc" href="#enc16">6.1</a>), and a cost-optimized version of this contest (inspired by Theorem <a class="enc" href="#enc14">5.4</a>), which allocates uniformly to the top <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\hat{q_{}}$</span>    </span> fraction of contributors, for <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\hat{q} = \max \left\lbrace \frac{1}{2}, 1 - \frac{1}{d-1} \right\rbrace$</span>    </span>. We also examine the performance of the less robust but better performing contests, which rely on a contribution threshold, namely the median mechanism (Section&#x00A0;<a class="enc" href="#enc13">5.3</a>) and the cost-optimized threshold mechanism (Section&#x00A0;<a class="enc" href="#enc14">5.4</a>).</p>    <p>To compare these mechanisms, we generated 50 random MHR distributions by first generating random virtual values, ensuring that the hazard rate condition was met, and then backing out a distribution that was consistent with these virtual values, with support <em>T</em> = {1, &#x2026;, 50}. For each distribution, we simulated 10,000 contests, and averaged their total contributions, for each of <em>n</em> = {1, &#x2026;, 300} symmetric players. Each player had cost <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$c_{i}(b_{}) = b_{}^d$</span>    </span>, for <em>d</em> &#x2208; {2, 3, 10, 20}. For each condition (contest, number of players, and <em>d</em> value), we report the ratio of the total contributions achieved to the optimal, averaged across all experiments.</p>    <p>We summarize the results of the experiments in Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>. In all cases, the experimental results suggest that our proposed mechanisms may perform much better in practice than our theoretical worst-case guarantees. We also ran these same experiments using regular, but not necessarily, MHR, distributions; the results were qualitatively the same.</p>    <p>Our experimental results also suggest that rather than allocating only to the best contributors, the optimal solution is to allocate to many, including some that may not be the best. Notice that, in our experiments, the contests that allocate only to the top quarter tend to perform worst, with decreasing performance as the number of players grows. In contrast, the other contest formats, where the number of winners varies with <em>d</em>, perform much better.</p>    <p>This phenomenon can be explained as follows: if the number of winners does not vary with <em>d</em>, performance necessarily degrades as <em>d</em> increases, because the contest collects a smaller and smaller fraction of contributions. On the other hand, by allowing for the possibility of more winners, the contest can collect more (of those smaller) contributions. Though individual contributions decrease as <em>d</em> increases, the difference between the highest and lowest contributions also decreases as <em>d</em> increases.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-11">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">8</span> Conclusion</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>In this work, we studied the problem of optimal contest design, where the designer&#x0027;s objective is to maximize the total expected quality of contributions assuming participants incur convex costs. This convex-cost model is a natural model of effort, as it takes more and more effort to improve the quality of a contribution as that quality increases (e.g., the 80/20 rule).</p>    <p>We began by establishing an equivalence between all-pay contests, which can be viewed as reverse mechanisms&#x2014;players submit contributions, which are costly to produce, and for which they are possibly rewarded with a prize&#x2014;and optimal direct mechanisms, in which players report their abilities, and are possibly allocated a prize in return for a contribution. On the other hand, we also noted that Myerson&#x0027;s theory of optimal mechanism design is not fully applicable in our setting. Indeed, a closed-form characterizaton of the optimal BIC/IIR mechanism with convex costs remains open.</p>    <p>Nonetheless, we were able to establish an upper bound on the optimal, which we used to derive approximation ratios for two simple and detail-free all-pay contest mechanisms, one of which allocates the prize uniformly to all players whose ability is above the median ability. We then noted that the spirit of the median mechanism can be achieved by allocating the prize uniformly to the top half of the contributors, and nothing to the rest. Similarly, our main theorem, for which we achieve a constant approximation to the optimal, allocates uniformly at random to the top quarter of the contributors, and nothing to rest.</p>    <p>Our main result stands in stark contrast to the optimal mechanism in the usual quasi-linear setting, where no one but the top contributors are ever allocated any portion of the prize. When costs are convex, and when the goal is to maximize the total quality of the contributions (i.e., total productivity), it can be very suboptimal to allocate to only the top contributors.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-12">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">9</span> Acknowledgments</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>This research was supported by NSF Grant #1217761 and Microsoft Research.</p>   </section>  </section>  <section class="back-matter">   <Appendix>    <section id="sec-13">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h2>       <span class="section-number">A</span> Omitted Proofs</h2>     </div>    </header>    <section id="sec-14">     <header>      <div class="title-info">       <h3>       <span class="section-number">A.1</span> Proof of Theorem&#x00A0;<a class="enc" href="#enc6">3.3</a>       </h3>      </div>     </header>     <p>Consider a direct mechanism with an ex-post allocation rule <em>x<sub>i</sub>      </em>: <em>T<sup>n</sup>      </em> &#x2192; [0, 1] and a deterministic contribution rule <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$h_i: T\rightarrow \mathbb {R}_{\ge 0}$</span>      </span> for each player <em>i</em>. We will implement the direct mechanism as an all-pay contest as follows: given the contribution of a player <em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>, use the interim contribution rule of the direct mechanism to map it back to the set of abilities that contribute <em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em> in the direct mechanism, i.e. <em>S<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>) = {<em>w<sub>i</sub>      </em> &#x2208; <em>T</em>: <em>h<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>w<sub>i</sub>      </em>) = <em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>}. Since the interim contribution rule is non-decreasing, the latter set is an interval [<em>L</em>(<em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>), <em>U</em>(<em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>)] and moreover these intervals are disjoint for different <em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em> and are consecutive. If a player submits a contribution that is not in the range of <em>h<sub>i</sub>      </em>(&#x00B7;), i.e. if <em>S<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>) is empty, then we map it to an ability of 0 and allocate 0 prize. Otherwise, we draw an ability from distribution <em>F</em>, conditional on the fact that the ability is in <em>S<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>), i.e. if <em>S<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>) is a singleton then we return this singleton otherwise we draw an ability from the distribution with support <em>S<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>) and CDF <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$G(v; b_{i}) =\frac{F(v)-F(L(b_{i}))}{F(U(b_{i})) - F(L(b_{i}))}$</span>      </span>. Let <em>z<sub>i</sub>      </em> be the resulting ability drawn from this process for player <em>i</em>. Then allocate to player <em>i</em> a prize of <em>x<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<strong>z</strong>) based on the ex-post allocation rule of the direct mechanism for the constructed ability vector <strong>z</strong>.</p>     <p>We will show that all players contributing <em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>v<sub>i</sub>      </em>) = <em>h<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>v<sub>i</sub>      </em>) is a BNE of the resulting all-pay contest. The latter would imply that the all-pay contest achieves the same expected contributions as the direct mechanism.</p>     <p>We first note that if all other players bid according to this BNE, then if a player <em>i</em> is assigned a value <em>z<sub>i</sub>      </em> from the aforementioned process, his interim allocation in the all-pay contest <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathop{\mathbb {E}}_{\mathbf {z_{}}_{-i}}\left[x_{i}(z_{i}, \mathbf {z_{}}_{-i})\right]$</span>      </span> (i.e. his expected allocation in expectation over the draws of his opponents abilities and the randomness of the contest) is equal to <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\hat{x_{}}}_{}(\mathbf {z_{}}_{i})$</span>      </span>, i.e. it is equal to the interim allocation of a player with ability <em>z<sub>i</sub>      </em> in the original direct mechanism. To argue this we only need to argue that the distribution of <em>z<sub>j</sub>      </em> for any <em>j</em> &#x2260; <em>i</em> follows exactly distribution <em>F</em>. Then the claim will follow by the definition of the interim allocation rule <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\hat{x_{}}}_{}(\cdot)$</span>      </span> of the direct mechanism. The fact that each <em>z<sub>j</sub>      </em> is drawn from <em>F</em> follows by our construction; the distribution of the random variable <em>z<sub>j</sub>      </em> is the result of the following process: first a value <em>v<sub>j</sub>      </em> is drawn from <em>F</em>, then a bid <em>b<sub>j</sub>      </em>(<em>v<sub>j</sub>      </em>) = <em>h<sub>j</sub>      </em>(<em>v<sub>j</sub>      </em>) is generated. Then the random variable <em>z<sub>j</sub>      </em> is drawn from the distribution of <em>F</em> constrained on the set <em>S<sub>j</sub>      </em>(<em>h<sub>j</sub>      </em>(<em>v<sub>j</sub>      </em>)). Let us look at the CDF of <em>z<sub>j</sub>      </em>: Consider a value <em>x</em> &#x2208; <em>T</em> and let <em>S<sub>j</sub>      </em>(<em>t</em>) = [<em>L</em>(<em>t</em>), <em>U</em>(<em>t</em>)] be the interval containing <em>x</em> in the partition of abilities defined by <em>h<sub>j</sub>      </em> (i.e. the partition of <em>T</em> such that all abilities in each part make the same contribution under rule <em>h<sub>j</sub>      </em>(&#x00B7;)). The probability that <em>z<sub>j</sub>      </em> falls below <em>x</em> is the probability that the player <em>j</em> has a true ability <em>v<sub>j</sub>      </em> that falls below <em>L</em>(<em>t</em>), plus the probability that it falls in interval <em>S<sub>j</sub>      </em>(<em>t</em>), times the probability that <em>z<sub>j</sub>      </em> drawn from distribution <em>F</em> conditional on interval <em>S<sub>j</sub>      </em>(<em>t</em>) falls below <em>x</em>. The latter is <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$F(L(t)) + \frac{F(x) - F(L(t))}{F(U(t)) - F(L(t))}(F(U(t)) - F(L(t))) = F(x)$</span>      </span>. This concludes our claim.</p>     <p>Second, observe that if two abilities <em>w<sub>i</sub>      </em> > <em>v<sub>i</sub>      </em> have the same deterministic contribution under <em>h<sub>i</sub>      </em>, i.e. <em>h<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>w<sub>i</sub>      </em>) = <em>h<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>v<sub>i</sub>      </em>), then it must be that their interim allocations in the direct mechanism are the same, i.e. <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\hat{x_{}}}_{i}(w_i)={\hat{x_{}}}_{i}(v_{i})$</span>      </span>. The latter follows by the strict monotonicity of the cost functions and the fact that the quantity inside <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$c_{i}^{-1}(\cdot)$</span>      </span> in Equation (<a class="eqn" href="#eq6">9</a>) is strictly larger for ability <em>w<sub>i</sub>      </em> than for ability <em>v<sub>i</sub>      </em> if <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\hat{x_{}}}_{i}(w_i){\gt}{\hat{x_{}}}_{i}(v_{i})$</span>      </span>. Hence, we can conclude that if a player submits a contribution <em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em> = <em>h<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>w<sub>i</sub>      </em>) in the all-pay contest for some ability <em>w<sub>i</sub>      </em>, then no matter what was the draw <em>z<sub>i</sub>      </em> of the random process of the contest, the expected prize allocation of the player in expectation over the abilities of opponents and the randomness of the contest, will be equal to <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\hat{x_{}}}_{i}(w_i)$</span>      </span>.</p>     <p>From our observations, we see that the expected utility of a player with ability <em>v<sub>i</sub>      </em> in the all-pay contest, if he submits a contribution <em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em> = <em>h<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>w<sub>i</sub>      </em>), is equal to the expected utility of that player in the direct mechanism if he reported an ability level of <em>w<sub>i</sub>      </em>, i.e. <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$v_{i} {\hat{x_{}}}_{i}(w_{i}) - h_i(w_{i})$</span>      </span>. Thus, by the BIC condition of the direct mechanism, the player in this all-pay contest does not want to deviate and contribute the amount that a player with any other ability would have contributed, since this would be equivalent to reporting that ability in the direct mechanism. Finally, a player does not want to submit a contribution <em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em> that is not in the range of <em>h<sub>i</sub>      </em>(&#x00B7;) since that yields zero utility. Thus each player contributing <em>b<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>v<sub>i</sub>      </em>) = <em>h<sub>i</sub>      </em>(<em>v<sub>i</sub>      </em>) is a BNE of the all-pay contest.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-15">     <header>      <div class="title-info">       <h3>       <span class="section-number">A.2</span> Proof of Theorem <a class="enc" href="#enc14">5.4</a>       </h3>      </div>     </header>     <p>We will first prove a Lemma which is an extension of the simplified prophet inequality that we used in the previous section.</p>     <div class="lemma" id="enc18">      <Label>Lemma A.1.</Label>      <p> For any regular distribution and for any <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\hat{q}\ge 1/2$</span>       </span>: <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$R(\hat{q}) \ge (1-\hat{q})R(q^*).$</span>       </span>      </p>     </div>     <div class="proof" id="proof5">      <Label>Proof.</Label>      <p> First suppose that <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$q^*\ge \hat{q}$</span>       </span>.

Hence, from standard analysis that can be found in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>], this implies that the proposed pair of bid function and interim allocation constitute a Bayes-Nash equilibrium. Uniqueness of this equilibrium follow from the results of [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. We now move on to analyzing the contributions of this equilibrium of the all-pay contest. For simplicity we will assume that the number of players is a multiple of 4. The result easily extends to the general case, albeit with more complex notation.</p>     <p>We first prove upper and lower bounds on the interim allocation of players as a function of their quantile <em>q<sub>i</sub>      </em> = 1 &#x2212; <em>F</em>(<em>v<sub>i</sub>      </em>). For any quantile <em>q</em>, denote with <em>X<sub>j</sub>      </em>(<em>q</em>) = 1{<em>q<sub>j</sub>      </em> &#x2264; <em>q</em>}. Observe that: <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathop{\mathbb {E}}[X_j(q)]=\Pr [q_j\le q]=q$</span>      </span>, since quantiles are distributed uniformly in [0, 1]. Moreover, if we denote with <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\hat{x_{}}}_{i}(q_i)$</span>      </span> the interim allocation of player <em>i</em> when he has quantile <em>q<sub>i</sub>      </em>, then: <div class="table-responsive" id="Xeq11">       <div class="display-equation">       <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} \textstyle {{\hat{x_{}}}_{i}(q_i) = \frac{4}{n} \Pr \left[ \sum _{j\ne i} X_j(q_i)\le \frac{n}{4}-1\right]} .\end{equation} </span>       <br/>       <span class="equation-number">(25)</span>       </div>      </div>     </p>     <p>Let <em>S</em>      <sub>       <em>n</em> &#x2212; 1</sub>(<em>q<sub>i</sub>      </em>) = &#x2211;<sub>       <em>j</em> &#x2260; <em>i</em>      </sub>      <em>X<sub>j</sub>      </em>(<em>q<sub>i</sub>      </em>).
