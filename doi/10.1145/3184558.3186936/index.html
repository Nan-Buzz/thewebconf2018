Still, previous studies in the field focus on the listeners&#x2019; mood, but do not consider the cause of the mood or the mood change. In contrast, we study whether real-world events, such as natural disasters, product launches, or political elections, influence people&#x0027;s music listening behavior, as a presumable cause of mood changes. As an initial step in this research endeavor, the work at hand focuses on the effect of world events on the number of songs people listen to per day.</p>    <p>To investigate this effect, we perform an exploratory study, in which we use Google Trends<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> to obtain world-wide events, and the LFM-1b dataset<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> of listening events by users of the music streaming service Last.fm,<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> from which we obtain the number of songs listened to by all users per day.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-6">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> Data Elicitation</h2>    </div>    </header>    <section id="sec-7">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.1</span> Acquiring Listening Events</h3>     </div>    </header>    <p>We exploit the LFM-1b dataset&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] containing over one billion listening events between 2005 and 2014, created by more than 120,000 Last.fm users. We perform an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analysis [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] to decompose the <em>absolute number of songs listened to by all users per day</em> into a trend, seasonal, and residuals component. Only the trend signal is considered as input to the ITSA (Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-9">3</a>) to remove effects possibly caused by re-occurring events (e.g., weekends or Christmas), and the variance in the number of users who are active on Last.fm on different days.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-8">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.2</span> Acquiring Real-world Events</h3>     </div>    </header>    <p>To identify events that have an impact on a world-wide basis, we use the events published by Google Trends in their <em>Year in Search</em> overview. For various categories, this overview provides the 10 most searched terms per year. We consider the categories <em>tech</em>, <em>events</em>, <em>music artists</em>, <em>popular</em>, <em>trending</em>, and <em>news</em>. In this paper, we use the term &#x201C;event&#x201D; to refer to any real-world event in the dataset, while the Google Trends category <em>events</em> refers to a subset of events, for example, sport tournament, festival, or incident. For each event, we identify the calendar day on which it was most often searched for. For example, the maximum number of searches for the term &#x201C;Michael Jackson&#x201D; between 2004 and 2017 is reached on June 26, 2009, which is the day after he passed away.</p>    <p>An overview of the distribution of events in the dataset per category is given in Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>. Please note that before 2012, Google only published a list of the most popular search terms, without categorizing them. <figure id="fig1">      <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186936/images/www18companion-176-fig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 1"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Distribution of events, per year and category.</span>      </div>     </figure>    </p>    </section>   </section>   <section id="sec-9">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">3</span> Modeling Effects Caused by Events</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>To identify effects that are possibly caused by a global event <em>E</em>, we perform an intervention time series analysis (ITSA)&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. To this end, we define two models that indicate a significant in- or decrease of the absolute number of listening events, as a cause of the event; respectively, we define two predictor variables. The first predictor variable <em>v</em>    <sub>1</sub> models a <em>linear in- or decrease of the signal</em>, indicating the days adjacent to the event <em>E</em>, starting from <em>-7</em> (a week before&#x00A0;<em>E</em>), to <em>7</em> (a week after&#x00A0;<em>E</em>). The second predictor variable <em>v</em>    <sub>2</sub> serves as a <em>threshold to model sudden in- or decreases</em> in the absolute number of listening events on the day the event occurs. To model this, the value of <em>v</em>    <sub>2</sub> is 0 for all the days before <em>E</em> and 1 for all days after <em>E</em>, including the day the event occurred. In case <em>v</em>    <sub>2</sub> adds significantly (<em>&#x03B1;</em> = 0.05) to a more accurate prediction of the <em>number of listening events</em>, a discontinuity is detected.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-10">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">4</span> Results and Discussion</h2>    </div>    </header>    <figure id="fig2">    <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186936/images/www18companion-176-fig2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 2"      longdesc=""/>    <div class="figure-caption">     <span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span>     <span class="figure-title">Relative number of events, per category, for which a discontinuity is found.</span>    </div>    </figure>    <p>Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> provides an overview of the share of events per category for which a discontinuity is detected. A particularly high share of discontinuities is identified for the <em>news</em> and <em>events</em> categories. Except for <em>tech</em> events, all shares are above a baseline that performs ITSA considering each day of the time-line as an event (18%). According to a one-tailed z-test, results for <em>news</em> are significant at <em>p</em> = 0.046, while results for <em>events</em> only at <em>p</em> = 0.055.</p>    <p>Next, we analyze whether more or less songs are listened to as a result of the event. To this end, Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> shows the relative changes in the total number of songs listened to by the entire pool of users, for those real-world events for which a discontinuity on the day of the event is identified. An <em>increase</em> is found for all events in the <em>news</em> category. This might follow from a change of the listeners&#x2019; mood because the majority of the events can be considered to have a high societal impact, often combined with a low valence level (e.g., missing of Malaysia Airlines flight 370). Listeners might start to listen to more music to regulate their changed mood. In contrast, for all <em>tech</em> events, the number of listening events decreases. We speculate that the release of technical products temporarily occupies people with activities other than listening to music, e.g., using the new product or making videos about it. <figure id="fig3">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186936/images/www18companion-176-fig3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 3"      longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 3:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Box plot of the changes in listening events (in %) for real-world events that result in a discontinuity.</span>     </div>    </figure>    </p>    <p>We note that the categories for which an unambiguous direction of the coefficients is found are the ones more likely to have an unambiguous level of valence, i.e., the events in the <em>news</em> category are most likely to have a low valence level, while the <em>popular</em> category contains events that can be both high and low in terms of valence. Given the predominant use of music for mood regulation&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>], we argue that the valence level of the event influences whether people listen to more or less music.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-11">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">5</span> Conclusion and Future Work</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>We analyzed changes in listening behavior that may follow from a global real-world event.

Also, an expansion of the event dataset with a more uniform distribution of the event types is desired. Moreover, events could be categorized according to people&#x0027;s emotional reactions to them. A further direction is to study regional differences of the effects.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-12">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>This work is supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): V579.</p>   </section>  </section>  <section class="back-matter">   <section id="ref-001">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2 class="page-brake-head">REFERENCES</h2>    </div>    </header>    <ul class="bibUl">    <li id="BibPLXBIB0001" label="[1]">Walter Gantz, Howard&#x00A0;M.
