        <p><small>Several prior studies have demonstrated the
        possibility of tracking the outbreak and spread of diseases
        using public tweets and other social media platforms.
        However, almost all such prior studies were restricted to
        geographically filtered English language tweets only. This
        study is the first to attempt a similar approach for Arabic
        language tweets originating from the Gulf Cooperation
        Council (GCC) countries. We obtained a list of commonly
        occurring diseases in the region from the Saudi Ministry of
        Health. We used both the English disease names as well as
        their Arabic translations to filter the stream of tweets.
        We acquired old tweets for a period spanning 29 months. All
        tweets were geographically filtered for the Middle East and
        the list of disease names in both English and Arabic
        languages. We observed that only a small fraction of tweets
        were in English, demonstrating that prior approaches to
        disease tracking relying on English language features are
        less effective for this region. We also demonstrate how
        Arabic language tweets can be used rather effectively to
        track the spread of some infectious diseases in the region.
        We verified our approach by demonstrating that a high
        degree of correlation between the occurrence of
        MERS-Coronavirus cases and Arabic language tweets on the
        disease. We also show that infectious diseases generating
        fewer tweets and non-infectious diseases do not exhibit the
        same high correlation. We also verify the usefulness of
        tracking cases using Twitter mentions by comparing against
        a ground truth data set of MERS-CoV cases obtained from the
        Saudi Ministry of Health.</small></p>

            Motivation</h3>

        </header>
        <p>Tracking the outbreak of diseases is an essential
        function of state health departments. Departments collect
        data from hospitals and compile it to produce a
        comprehensive picture. The typical time between the
        emergence of a cluster of patients, to its identification
        and any public announcements is approximately two weeks. In
        recent years there have been several attempts to leverage
        the near-realtime availability of web data sources to
        reduce this lead time. Most of these studies and
        experiments were conducted on English language content,
        with others in French [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>], Spanish [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>] and Chinese [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. Many of
        these prior studies were also limited to specific countries
        or geographic regions. In this study we apply the concept
        to the Arabian peninsula, which is home to the Gulf
        Cooperation Countries (GCC, which include Saudi Arabia,
        Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE and Oman) and Yemen.
        Moreover, most social media use in the region occurs in the
        local language, Arabic, with only a fraction in
        English.</p>

        <p>The research question we try to answer in this study is
        the following: <em>Are techniques for disease tracking from

            State-of-the-Art</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The approaches used in the prior state-of-the-art span
        three approaches: (1) Collect data from hospitals and
        health facilities, compile it and detect any disease
        outbreaks [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>,
        <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>,
        <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>,
        <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>]. Since
        this approach relies on first-hand data this is considered
        the most reliable and error free approach. However, it
        comes at the cost of a high lead time of approximately two
        weeks between the beginning of an outbreak and its
        detection. (2) Periodically crawl public web data sources,
        RSS feeds and search engine trend information for reports
        on disease outbreaks [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. These approaches are not as
        reliable as the first approach and are therefore used to
        compliment slower but more reliable methods based on first
        hand data. (3) The third type of approach scavenges posts
        on various social media platforms to detect disease
        outbreaks [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>,
        <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>,
        <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. Given
        the unverified nature of social media posts, these
        approaches are perhaps least trustworthy. However, they
        operate on near real-time data which means they have the
        lowest lag-time.</p>
        <p>Moreover, web-based approaches, whether they operate on
        RSS feeds or social media posts, are language and region
        dependent.</p>

        <p>In this study we collected a data set of Arabic language

        data sets, one for each disease, span a period of two years
        and five months. We produce the histogram of the volume of
        tweets mentioning each disease and observe which diseases
        appear more frequently on Twitter and see how it relates to
        the official data.</p>

      <p>Brownstein et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] were among the early users of
      web-sourced data for the early detection of disease
      outbreaks. They developed HealthMap a website that crawls and
      retrieves news articles from public news aggregators every 15
      minutes.</p>
      <p>Another widely used approach leverages the fact that a
      large proportion of people in the developed world often turn
      to the Internet to search for advice on symptoms and
      treatments [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. Access to
      search engine query trends are an additional source of near
      real-time data that can be leveraged. Every search engine
      query has a timestamp and is tied to a user's IP address,
      which can be mapped back to the user's location with a
      significant degree of accuracy. This means search trends can
      be broken down to a fine temporal and spatial resolution.
      Microsoft's Bing Keyword Research [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] and Google's Google
      Trends [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]
      are two examples of widely used search engines that have made
      their search query information available to the public. Pelat
      et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]
      used this approach to track diseases from Google Trends.
      Valdivia and Monge-Corella [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>] also used Google Trends to validate
      this approach for Spain and using Spanish language search
      terms. While the high degree of location and temporal
      accuracy may make this approach seem ideal it has a serious
      drawback - it is just as easy for a malicious user to tamper
      with these trends by deliberately inflating search queries
      for targeted terms. Butler [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] reported on a flu season in which
      Google trends drastically overestimated the spread of
      flu.</p>
      <p>Search query based approaches also require can only be
      relied on in societies that enjoy a high rate of Internet
      connectivity. In poorer, less well-connected societies like
      Pakistan disease mapping is done by replacing the dependence
      on search trends with survey teams and footwork, as
      documented by Rojahn [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>]. Obviously, this approach adds a
      significant cost that is not incurred in search trend based
      approaches.</p>
      <p>Corley et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] used <a class=
      "link-inline force-break" href=
      "http://spinn3r.com">spinn3r.com</a>, a now defunct blog
      indexing service, to search blogs for mentions of influenza.
      They were able to show high correlation between mentions of
      influenza on <a class="link-inline force-break" href=
      "http://spinn3r.com">spinn3r.com</a> indexed blogs and CDC
      surveillance data. The study was limited to English language
      content only was limited to a relatively short period of only
      20 weeks.</p>
      <p>Culotta [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]
      took the same approach and applied it to Twitter. However, it
      too was limited to English language content about influenza
      cases in the US over just 10 weeks.</p>
      <p>Chunara et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] compared the delays between cholera
      case reports in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake of
      2010. They considered data spanning a period of 100 days from
      the Haitian Ministry of Health, HealthMap and Twitter. The
      study was limited to English and French language Twitter
      feeds.</p>
      <p>Subsequent surveys of early detection of diseases such as
      Schmidt [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]
      and Bernardo et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] have shown that almost prior studies
      relied on non-Arabic language data and none have been tested
      and applied to the Arabian peninsula.</p>

      <p>To obtain a list of commonly occurring diseases in the
      region, we turned to the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of
      Saudi Arabia as our reference source [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>]. The list is quite
      extensive and was mapped to the 40 Arabic language keywords
      shown on the horizontal axis of Figure <a class="fig" href=
      "#fig1">1</a>. The tweets were geo-filtered for the Arabian
      peninsula and span a period of two years and five months,
      from Jan 01, 2015 to 31 May, 2017. The data set comprises of
      180,503 tweets in total collected using the facilities of the
      Web Observatory of the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah,
      Saudi Arabia. Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> shows
      a histogram of search terms and the corresponding number of
      unique tweets that were captured as part of the data set.
      Also overlaid with the histogram is the cumulative histogram
      curve. The cumulative histogram curve shows that only the
      nine most frequently occurring keywords account for 95% of
      all tweets in the data set. Tweets relating to the Middle
      East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) are the
      most common and alone make up for approximately 35% of all
      tweets in the data set.</p>

        <p>We plotted the time-series of tweets for each disease
        alongside the volume of searches obtained from Google trend
        in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> and Figure
        <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a><a class="fn" href="#fn1"
        id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Please, note that the
        number of tweets plotted against each week on the time-axis
        include the original tweets, their retweet count and their
        favorite count<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id=
        "foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Visual inspection shows
        remarkable similarity between the time-series of Twitter
        and Google searches for MERS-CoV. This degree of similarity
        is also quantified by the correlation coefficients listed
        in Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a>. The high degree
        of similarity between the time-series for MERS-CoV is borne
        out by its correlation coefficient of 0.999855. As the
        entries in Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> show,
        there is a general downward trend in those values,
        <em>i.e.</em> correlation coefficient goes down with
        decrease in data set size. With the exception of MERS-Cov
        and Cholera, none of the diseases at the top of the list
        are infectious or exhibit any seasonality. This is
        reflected by the noisy nature of their time-series and
        their correspondingly low correlation coefficients.</p>
        <p>An exception to this rule is breast cancer, which shows
        two coinciding peaks in both tweet and Google search
        time-series. These are explained by the fact that October
        is breast cancer awareness month [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], which are the times
        when peaks occur in both signals.</p>
        <p>Cholera and swine flu, the only other infectious
        diseases besides MERS-CoV, have relatively low correlation
        coefficients of 0.316445 and 0.201707, respectively. This
        is explained by the fact that the data sets for cholera and
        swine flu are both very small. As a matter of fact, there
        is a steep drop-off in the size of disease data sets after
        breast cancer, the fourth on the list.</p>

        </header>
        <p>We continue the analysis of mentions of diseases in
        Arabic language tweets only for MERS-CoV. Of the other
        eight diseases hardly any garners as much traffic on
        Twitter as MERS-CoV. Furthermore, most of them are chronic
        in nature, rather than seasonal of infectious.</p>
        <p>In this section we analyzed the time-series of Arabic
        tweets mentioning MERS-CoV by comparing it with the
        epicurve<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
        "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> of MERS-CoV obtained from the
        Saudi Ministry of Health [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]. The epicurve data can be
        considered ground truth for the number of cases. Figure
        <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> is a plot of the MERS-CoV
        epicurve and its tweets time-series. Both curves exhibit
        strong similarities with overlapping peaks. The correlation
        coefficient of both curves is 0.74, which can be
        interpreted as modest-to-high correlation The high
        correlation with the Google search time-series and the
        moderate-to-high correlation with the epicurve go to show
        that the time-series of Arabic language tweets is effective
        at tracking the size of outbreaks of MERS-CoV cases in the
        GCC region.</p>

      <p>In this study we considered the possibility of monitoring
      the volume of tweets as a means to detecting outbreaks of
      diseases in the GCC region. Since the overwhelming majority
      of Twitter traffic in the GCC region is in Arabic, we used
      Arabic language keywords. We performed this study for all
      diseases prevalent in the region, infectious or otherwise,
      and in the first stage used data from Google trends as ground
      truth data.</p>
      <p>We obtained a list of diseases common to the GCC region
      from the Saudi Ministry of Health. Our analysis shows that
      only a small subset of those diseases are talkd about on
      Twitter. The tweets for the top nine diseases account for 95%
      of the data set we collected over a 29 month period. Of those
      nine diseases only three (MERS-CoV, cholera, swine flu) are
      infectious diseases, but only MERS-CoV appears to regularly
      generate sufficient traffic to be useful for analysis. We
      also observed that seasonal public awareness campaigns for
      non-infectious diseases like breast cancer can also exhibit
      moderate, albeit artificial, correlation.</p>
      <p>In order to further establish the correctness of our
      conclusion regarding MERS-CoV we also obtained the epicurve
      for it from the Saudi Ministry of Health. Analysis showed
      that the time-series of the number of tweets about MERS-CoV
      exhibits a modest-to-high correlation with the epicurve.</p>
      <p>We conclude that, at present Twitter traffic volume, in
      the GCC region MERS-CoV is the only infectious disease for
      which Twitter traffic may be used for the early detection of
      outbreaks.</p>
