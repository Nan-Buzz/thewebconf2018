      <div class="abstract">
        <p><small>Linked Data for Production (LD4P) is a
        collaboration between six institutions (Columbia, Cornell,
        Harvard, Library of Congress, Princeton, and Stanford) to
        begin the transition of technical services production
        workflows from a series of library-centric data formats
        (MARC) to ones based in Linked Open Data (LOD). This first
        phase of the transition focuses on the development of the
        ability to produce metadata as LOD communally, the
        enhancement of the BIBFRAME ontology to encompass the
        multiple resource formats that academic libraries must
        process, and the engagement of the broader academic library
        community to ensure a sustainable and extensible
        environment. As its name implies, LD4P focuses on the
        immediate needs of metadata production such as ontology
        coverage and workflow transition. The LD4P partners’ work
        will be based, in part, on a collection of tools that
        currently exist, such as those developed by the Library of
        Congress. The cyclical feedback of use and enhancement
        request to the developers of these tools will allow for
        their enhancement based on use in an actual production
        environment. The six institutions involved will focus on
        materials ranging from art to rare books, from cartographic
        materials to music, from annotations to workflows. Tool
        development and enhancement will also be a key aspect of
        the project. By the end of the first phase of this project
        (Spring 2018), the partners will have the minimal tooling,
        workflows, and standards developed to begin the
        transformation from MARC to LOD in Phase 2 of the
        project.</small></p>

          <h2>IMPORTANCE AND TIMELINE</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Libraries’ data architecture is based upon a series of
      communication formats developed in the 1960s called
      MAchine-Readable Cataloging, or MARC. It has become the de
      facto standard for how libraries ingest and communicate data
      to each other. It has also become the standard on which
      libraries’ Integrated Library Systems (ILS) are built and
      with which library vendors communicate their data to
      libraries. It has become apparent, however, that library
      patrons have been turning to the Web, especially the semantic
      web, in search of data. It is essential that libraries
      transform their antiquated technology stack and move onto the
      Web as their means of disseminating, and gathering, data. The
      transition will be a highly disruptive one and must move
      forward as quickly as possible as the shift to the Web for
      most library patrons has already occurred. LD4P hopes to
      develop the core technologies to make this transition
      possible by the end of the current grant cycle and to move a
      core group of libraries into implementation phase by the end
      of the next grant cycle (2020).</p>

          <h2>CONTENT OF THE PRESENTATION</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The presentation will focus on three main areas. The first
      will be the problems associated with the MARC formats and why
      it is essential for libraries to shift to a standard Web
      means of ingesting and disseminating data. The second will
      focus on the individual projects of the six institutions and
      how they contribute to this transformation. The last will
      highlight developing issues that must be resolved as the
      group moves into its next phase of development.</p>
