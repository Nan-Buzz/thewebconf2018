        <p><small>Wikipedia is one of the top visited resources on
        the Web, furthermore, it is used extensively as the main
        source of information for applications like Web search,
        question &amp; answering etc. This is mostly attributed to
        Wikipedia's coverage in terms of topics and real-world
        entities and the fact that Wikipedia articles are
        constantly updated with new and emerging facts.</small></p>
        <p><small>However, only a small fraction of articles are
        considered to be of <em>good quality</em>. The large
        majority of articles are incomplete and have other quality
        issues. A strong quality indicator is the presence of
        <em>external references</em> from third-party sources (e.g.
        news sources) as suggested by the <em>verifiability</em>
        principle in Wikipedia. Even for the existing references in
        Wikipedia there is an inherent lag in terms of the
        publication time of cited resources and the time they are
        cited in Wikipedia articles.</small></p>
        <p><small>We propose a near real-time suggestion of news
        references for Wikipedia from a daily news stream. We model
        daily news into specific events, spanning from a day up to
        year. Thus, we construct an event-chain from which we
        determine when the information in an event has
        <em>converged</em> and consequentially based on a
        <em>learning-to-rank</em> approach suggest the most
        authoritative and complete news article to Wikipedia
        articles involved in a specific event.</small></p>
        <p><small>We evaluate our news suggestion approach on a set
        of 41 events extracted from Wikipedia currents event
        portal, and on new corpus consisting of daily news between
        the period of 2016-2017 with more than 14 million news
        articles. We are able to suggest news articles to Wikipedia
        pages with an overall accuracy of MAP=0.77 and with a
        minimal lag w.r.t the publication time of the news
        article.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Wikipedia is in the top-5 most visited pages on the
      Web<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
      Apart from its direct visitors, Wikipedia implicitly affects
      millions of users through question answering applications
      like Apple's Siri, or web search through Google's knowledge
      graph. Therefore, it is essential that the state of Wikipedia
      articles is consistent and up to date.</p>
      <p>In Wikipedia, the burden of providing and maintaining the
      information in Wikipedia articles rests on Wikipedia editors,
      which together with a set of principles and guidelines tries
      to ensure the quality of articles. Most notably, is the
      <em>verifiability</em> principle<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id=
      "foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>, which requests that information
      in Wikipedia articles should be verifiable by means of
      external references, preferably of third-party sources, with
      <em>news</em> being the second most cited
      source&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>].</p>
      <p>Due to the fact that Wikipedia articles are edited on a
      voluntarily basis by its editors, often there is a
      discrepancy on the quality of the Wikipedia articles and
      their overall demand on the Web&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. Furthermore, more than
      51% of articles are marked as <em>stubs</em> (articles in
      need for expansion)<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
      "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Enriching and extending
      Wikipedia articles with missing and additional information
      has been the focus of extensive research&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. Previous work has
      considered the enrichment task as a static approach, where
      for a given Wikipedia snapshot and existing document
      collections, news or other Web documents are suggested to
      matching Wikipedia articles and their corresponding sections.
      Depending on the periodicity of such updates, there is an
      inherent lag between the publication time of a news article
      or Web page reporting an important event and the time it is
      added into its corresponding Wikipedia article.</p>
      <p>In this work, we address the deficiencies of snapshot
      enrichment&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>] and propose an approach, which
      suggests news to Wikipedia articles in an automated manner.
      First, we analyze and <em>extract events</em> from the daily
      news stream and furthermore construct an <em>event-chain</em>
      based on events from previous time-points, with the intuition
      that events may span from one day up to years. Next, from the
      constructed event chain, we determine the important Wikipedia
      entities involved in it, and when the information in an event
      has <em>converged</em> we use a learning-to-rank (L2R)
      approach to <em>suggest</em> news articles to the
      corresponding Wikipedia articles.</p>
      <p>In our experimental evaluation, we show that our approach
      provide guarantees in terms of minimizing the lag,
      specifically, minimizing the difference between the
      publication time of a news article and the time it is added
      into the corresponding Wikipedia article. At the same time,
      our suggestion based on the L2R approach are accurate with an
      overall MAP score of MAP=0.77 for a set of 40 events, with
      daily news ranging between 2016-2017 and with more than 14
      million news articles.</p>

      <p>In this section, we review related literature which deals
      with Wikipedia enrichment and event chaining from news
      media.</p>
      <p><strong>Event Chaining.</strong> Event extraction and
      summarization has been focus of extensive
      research&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>]. An important aspect when dealing
      with events is their span. Events may span from a single day,
      and with large-spanning events with years. Thus, constructing
      an event chain across time is important in order to be able
      to analyze the complete information from an event. Setty et
      al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>]
      use a clustering approach for constructing an event chain by
      first clustering news articles on a given day, and then
      constructing a chain amongst such clusters between
      consecutive days. We follow a similar approach to [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>], however,
      we use Word-Movers distance&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], which based on our
      experimental evaluation achieves near optimal clustering
      accuracy.</p>
      <p><strong>Wikipedia Enrichment.</strong> Another line of
      research looks at the problem of Wikipedia enrichment as a
      static process. An imminent problem with such approaches is
      that there is a constant lag between information published in
      external sources like news media, and the time they are added
      and referenced in Wikipedia. The works in&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>] propose
      approaches that for a given Wikipedia article find relevant
      and important news or general Web documents for suggestion.
      However, one crucial challenge in updating Wikipedia in near
      real-time is to be able to model <em>events</em> and
      <em>event-chains</em> from external sources like news, and
      furthermore detect when the information in an event has
      converged and is ripe for suggestion to the corresponding
      Wikipedia articles involved in it.</p>
      <p>An important part of Wikipedia is articles that refer to
      real world events. Georgescu et al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] propose approaches that
      leverage the frequency of edits for given articles for event
      detection in Wikipedia. Specifically, through the added
      excerpts in the Wikipedia pages they come with a
      representation of an event. Similarly, Mishra et
      al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]
      propose to link excerpts from Wikipedia events and link them
      to online news-archives, and thus, provide evidence for
      already exciting events in Wikipedia. Similar to the other
      Wikipedia enrichment works, our contribution and at the same
      time the diverging point is our ability to monitor events and
      construct event-chains, which we use in our decision process
      on when to suggest news articles related to an event for
      enriching the involved Wikipedia entities, respectively the
      corresponding articles.</p>
      <p>Finally, as we show in Section&nbsp;, there is a
      discrepancy in the focus of Wikipedia editors and their
      contributions in contrast to the demands from the general Web
      users&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>].
      For some events, information from external sources is
      reflected within minutes &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>], while in other cases such delay can
      be significant and is dependent on the periodicity of
      snapshot enrichments&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. Hence, real-time and continuous
      approaches that monitor events are necessary for updating
      Wikipedia and keeping it in a consistent state.</p>

        <p>We consider events from Wikipedia's current event portal
        (WCP) <em>E</em> = {<em>e</em> <sub>1</sub>, â€¦,
        <em>e<sub>n</sub></em> }. For each event <em>e</em> âˆˆ
        <em>E</em>, we distinguish the <em>actors</em> involved in
        this event, which in our case represent Wikipedia articles,
        which we refer with <em>a</em>(<em>e</em>) = {<em>a</em>
        <sub>1</sub>, â€¦, <em>a<sub>n</sub></em> }. Furthermore,
        each event consists of a <em>textual description</em>,
        which we refer to with <em>desc</em>(<em>e</em>), a set of
        references pointing to news sources, that is,
        <em>n</em>(<em>e</em>) = {<em>n</em> <sub>1</sub>, â€¦,
        <em>n<sub>k</sub></em> }, and the <em>event date</em> â€“
        <em>date</em>(<em>e</em>) or simply <em>t<sub>e</sub></em>
        .</p>
        <p>The set of references from events in <em>E</em> are
        drawn from a daily-news stream <em>N</em>, which is
        comprised from news articles reported by multiple news
        domains <em>D</em>(<em>N</em>) = {<em>d</em> <sub>1</sub>,
        â€¦, <em>d<sub>n</sub></em> }. Each news article <em>n</em> âˆˆ
        <em>N</em> consists of <em>n</em> = âŸ¨<em>date</em>,
        <em>title</em>, <em>body</em>âŸ©, and we will refer to the
        publication date of a news article with
        <em>t<sub>n</sub></em> . The set of news articles reported
        at a given time point <em>t</em> we will indicate with

        <p>Finally, with <em>A</em> = {<em>a</em> <sub>1</sub>, â€¦,
        <em>a<sub>n</sub></em> } we refer to the set of Wikipedia
        articles. For each article we distinguish between their
        different revisions and differentiate them by the time they
        are committed. We will refer to the <em>i</em>-th revision
        at time <em>t</em> of an article <em>a</em> as <span class=

        <p>In this work, we tackle the problem of suggesting in
        real-time news articles from a specific event to Wikipedia
        articles. We distinguish between two main tasks in this
        work.</p>
        <p><strong>Event Chain.</strong> For a given news stream
        <em>N</em>, consisting of daily articles, and an event of
        interest <em>e</em>, the task is to first extract news
        articles <em>n</em>(<em>e</em>) that are relevant to
        <em>e</em>, and construct an <em>event-chain</em> by
        monitoring the news articles at time points <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$t_n \le t_e \le
        t^{\prime }_n$</span></span> . The resulting event-chain
        will consists of a chronological order of news articles
        <em>e<sub>c</sub></em> = {âŸ¨<em>n</em> <sub>1</sub>, â€¦,
        <em>n<sub>k</sub></em> âŸ© <sub><em>t</em> âˆ’ <em>i</em></sub>
        , â€¦âŸ¨<em>n</em> <sub>1</sub>, â€¦, <em>n<sub>k</sub></em> âŸ©

        <em>n<sub>k</sub></em> âŸ© <sub><em>t</em> + <em>i</em></sub>
        }.</p>
        <p><strong>News Suggestions.</strong> From the event-chain
        <em>e<sub>c</sub></em> , the task is to monitor the
        reported information about event <em>e</em> at different
        time points from news articles and decide when and which
        articles to suggest, such that they fulfill two key
        properties based on the verifiability principle in
        Wikipedia<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id=
        "foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a>: (i) the news article is
        relevant for the event <em>e</em>, and (ii) the information

      event <em>e</em> which is published at a time
      <em>t<sub>e</sub></em> and consists of two main steps: (i)
      for event <em>e</em> it analyzes a news-stream of daily news,
      and constructs an event-chain spanning across multiple days,
      and (ii) from the event-chain it decides when and which news
      articles to suggest for the Wikipedia articles
      <em>a</em>(<em>e</em>) involved in <em>e</em>.</p>

        <p>The event <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

        example of an event from the Wikipedia's Current Event
        Portal published at a given time <em>t<sub>e</sub></em> .
        Furthermore, each event points to a set of news references
        <em>n</em>(<em>e</em>) and involves directly a set of
        Wikipedia articles <em>a</em>(<em>e</em>). For the
        Wikipedia articles involved in <em>e</em>, the information
        contained in it is a strong candidate for addition into the
        corresponding articles. However, as it is in many cases,
        events may span from a <em>single day</em>, <em>weeks</em>,
        <em>months</em> or even more, <em>years</em>. Therefore, it
        is of great importance to be able and determine the event
        chain <em>ec</em> = {âŸ¨<em>n</em>1, â€¦,
        <em>n<sub>k</sub></em> âŸ© <sub><em>t</em> âˆ’ <em>i</em></sub>
        , â€¦, âŸ¨<em>n</em> <sub>1</sub>, â€¦, <em>n<sub>k</sub></em> âŸ©
        <sub><em>t</em> + <em>i</em></sub> } such that for an event
        <em>e</em> we can pick news articles that are most relevant
        for Wikipedia articles <em>a</em>(<em>e</em>) and most
        authoritative.</p>

        <p><strong>News Retrieval.</strong> To establish the
        event-chain for <em>ec</em>, we first need to find relevant
        news articles from our news-stream <em>N</em> for event
        <em>e</em>. We do so by taking an information retrieval
        approach for generating candidate news articles for
        <em>e</em>. We query our news-stream index
        <em>N</em><a class="fn" href="#fn5" id=
        "foot-fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> by first constructing a query
        from the event description <em>desc</em>(<em>e</em>) based
        on an approach proposed by Henzinger et al.&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. From a
        given event collection and their description, the approach
        ranks the event description terms based on <em>tf-idf</em>
        weights. Our query for <em>e</em> consists of the topâ€“5
        highest ranked keywords from <em>desc</em>(<em>e</em>).</p>
        <p>As a query similarity model we use the divergence from
        randomness&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>], and consider several retrieval
        combinations: (i) query the <em>body</em> of a news
        article, (ii) query the <em>title</em> of the news article,
        and (iii) query both the <em>title</em> and <em>body</em>
        of the news article.</p>
        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> shows the
        ability to retrieve the news articles
        <em>n</em>(<em>e</em>) at specific cut-off points in the
        topâ€“<em>k</em> for the different query settings. We see
        that by considering the topâ€“500 news articles for
        constructing the event-chain <em>ec</em> we do nearly get
        perfect recall for the relevant news articles for
        <em>e</em>.</p>
        <figure id="fig1">
          <img src=

        </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>At each retrieval step, we restrict our model to
        retrieve the topâ€“500 news articles that are within a week
        of the given date <em>t<sub>i</sub></em> . In a similar
        fashion we make our way down in the news-stream, by
        retrieving one week slices of topâ€“500 articles <em>t</em>
        <sub><em>i</em> âˆ’ 1</sub> &lt; <em>t<sub>i</sub></em> . To
        construct the event chain, we start from the event date
        <em>t<sub>e</sub></em> , and cluster the news articles
        based on the Word Mover's distance (WMD)&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. WMD
        assigns two news articles in the same cluster based on
        their distance, which is computed based on the distance of
        the word embeddings of the individual words in the
        respective documents.</p>
        <p>By clustering news articles at each time slice, we
        connect clusters from adjacent dates, and thus obtain an
        event chain <em>ec</em> = {âŸ¨<em>n</em>1, â€¦,
        <em>n<sub>k</sub></em> âŸ© <sub><em>t</em> âˆ’ <em>i</em></sub>
        , â€¦, âŸ¨<em>n</em> <sub>1</sub>, â€¦, <em>n<sub>k</sub></em> âŸ©
        <sub><em>t</em> + <em>i</em></sub> } which may span across
        days, weeks or even years.</p>
        <p>One limitation here is that for an event <em>e</em> we
        expect to have a set of relevant news articles, such that
        we can perform the event-chaining. However, such a
        limitation can be addressed by following approaches
        proposed in Fetahu et al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>], where the event
        description can be used to find relevant news articles.</p>

        <p>Information in Wikipedia articles is centered around
        events. As such, events trigger updates in the
        corresponding Wikipedia articles, and in some cases they
        account for the actual creation of Wikipedia
        articles&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>].</p>
        <p>In this approach, we pose the task of news suggestion
        for Wikipedia articles <em>a</em>(<em>e</em>) = {<em>a</em>
        <sub>1</sub>, â€¦, <em>a<sub>n</sub></em> } involved in an
        event <em>e</em> as a ranking problem. We do this by
        considering news articles which are part of the event chain
        <em>ec</em>, where we slice the event-chain in a window of
        three days. The intuition behind such a slicing is that we
        want to observe the reporting of news media w.r.t
        <em>e</em> such that we suggest the most complete
        information about <em>e</em> and from most authoritative
        news media. This intuition is based on empirical
        observation from our experimental setup.
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> shows an
        example of an event-chain for an example event in our

            date of the referred news article.</span>
          </div>
        </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>We notice that usually the referred news articles for
        <em>e</em> in the corresponding Wikipedia articles come
        from the peak of the distribution of news-articles reported
        in our event-chain <em>ec</em>. This is somewhat intuitive
        as the information about an event has converged, in the
        sense, that we are in hold of the complete picture
        regarding <em>e</em>, and we are able to pick relevant and
        authoritative news-articles for suggestion.</p>
        <p>These observations determine the choice of our features
        and provide the intuition therein. For the news suggestion
        approach, we use a learning-to-rank (L2R) approach, where
        we train a <em>point-wise</em> L2R approach using logistic
        regression as our model. The features take into account a
        time window of three days in the event-chain, and they are
        described below:</p>
        <p><strong>News article frequency.</strong> In the
        event-chain, we consider the frequency of news-articles
        reported about event <em>e</em>, and furthermore we
        consider the increase w.r.t the adjacent timepoint based on
        an exponential moving average. This feature captures the
        popularity of an event amongst the news media <em>D</em>
        from our news stream <em>N</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Domain diversity.</strong> The number of diverse
        news domains <em>D</em> reporting about <em>e</em>
        similarly reflects the popularity of event <em>e</em>. The
        diversity is represented as the ratio of domains reporting
        about <em>e</em> w.r.t the total number of domains on that
        particular day.</p>
        <p><strong>Domain authority.</strong> A crucial factor in
        suggesting news to Wikipedia articles, is the authority and
        reliability of news media. We compute a domain prior from
        the entire Wikipedia collection, thus, favoring news
        articles coming from more authoritative domains. The
        intuition here is that even though a news article might be
        relevant at an earlier time-point, we will favor a news
        article coming from a later time-point but from a more
        authoritative domain.</p>
        <p><strong>Event Convergence.</strong> Here we capture the
        <em>information gain</em> between adjacent time-points in
        our event-chain. The intuition here is that for emerging
        events, where new information becomes available, we decide
        to wait until such information gain becomes minimal, and
        thus an indicator that the event has converged in terms of
        information. For this purpose we compute the
        Kullback-Leibler divergence between the unigram language
        models of news articles in a time point
        <em>t<sub>i</sub></em> and <em>t</em> <sub><em>i</em> âˆ’
        1</sub>. However, in our experimental setup this feature
        did not prove to be useful. We hypothesize that the reason
        for this is that the set of events in our experimental
        setup did not have developing stories with emerging
        information.</p>

        <p><strong>Events.</strong> In this work, we use the
        Wikipedia's current event portal (WCEP) as our source of
        events. Events from WCEP are published on a daily basis by
        Wikipedia editors, where for each event <em>e</em> we have
        the set of involved entities (or Wikipedia articles)
        <em>a</em>(<em>e</em>), a textual description
        <em>desc</em>(<em>e</em>), and external links serving as
        evidence to the event, specifically the set of news
        articles <em>n</em>(<em>e</em>).</p>
        <p>We handpick a set of 40 events, which involve highly
        authoritative Wikipedia articles, e.g. <em>Donald Trump,
        Hillary Clinton</em> etc. From the events, we use the set
        of Wikipedia articles <em>a</em>(<em>e</em>) as our target
        articles for suggesting information about a particular
        event <em>e</em>, specifically the set of news articles
        providing evidence for <em>e</em>.</p>
        <p>From the set of 40 events, we have a set of 58 Wikipedia
        articles as candidates for news suggestions. The total
        number of news articles referred by our set of events
        consists of 6833 news articles.</p>
        <p><strong>News-Stream.</strong> We operate on a news
        stream of daily articles in the period between 2014 and
        2017. It consists of 22 million news articles, from a set
        of 4300 news domain. The articles represent a crawl by the
        Gdelt project<a class="fn" href="#fn6" id=
        "foot-fn6"><sup>6</sup></a>, which indexes news articles
        across the world that are in English language. Finally, the
        general news-stream is combined together with news articles
        referred from our event set. This represents a real-world
        scenario where we need to find relevant news articles for a
        particular event from a large collection of news
        articles.</p>
        <p>If we compare the number of news articles in our
        news-stream against the number of news articles that are
        already referred by our event set, we see the difficulty of
        the problem on finding relevant news articles for
        suggestion.</p>
        <p><strong>Wikipedia.</strong> From the set of all
        Wikipedia articles in our set of events, we extract their
        entire revision history. We search through the revision
        history of each Wikipedia article and find the first
        occurrence of an external reference to a news article that
        is associated with event <em>e</em>. We consider the
        occurrence of a news article <em>n</em> âˆˆ
        <em>n</em>(<em>e</em>) as an indicator that the event
        information is reflected by the <em>i</em>-th revision of
        article <em>a</em><a class="fn" href="#fn7" id=
        "foot-fn7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>The time difference between the publication time of news

        <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

        <em>lag</em>, which is a measure we optimize for apart from

        <p>Here we discuss the evaluation strategies we undertake
        for measuring the accuracy of our event-based news
        suggestion approach. We describe the process of
        ground-truth acquisition and the evaluation strategies we
        undertake.</p>
        <p><strong>Wikipedia Ground-Truth.</strong>. An automated
        way of evaluating our event-based news suggestion approach,
        is to see how well our L2R approach is able to rank in the
        topâ€“10 ranked set of news articles <em>n</em>(<em>e</em>)
        for an event <em>e</em> and Wikipedia article
        <em>a</em>.</p>
        <p>This represents a very restrictive ground-truth, since
        for any event <em>e</em> the choice of news articles vary
        only by a handful of Wikipedia editors and only few news
        articles are necessary to cover an event. However, there
        are two main issues with such a ground-truth: (i) the news
        article may be from a news domain which is not of optimal
        authority, and (ii) there may be news articles of earlier
        publication time <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$t_{n^{\prime }} \ll t_{n}$</span></span> , thus
        increasing the amount of lag between the actual event date
        and the addition of the event information into the articles
        <em>a</em>(<em>e</em>) and (iii) the news articles may not
        be selected properly by editors when similar events happen
        repetitively. Therefore, we consider a second ground-truth
        described next.</p>
        <p><strong>Crowdsourced Ground-Truth.</strong>. For an
        event-chain we construct for an event <em>e</em>, we rank a
        topâ€“10 set of news articles which we deem as suitable for
        suggestion through our L2R approach to the corresponding
        Wikipedia article <em>a</em>(<em>e</em>). However, only for
        a handful of news articles for an event <em>e</em> we have
        explicit labels through the WCEP as described above. Hence,
        for the remainder of unlabelled news articles in our topâ€“10
        we perform a crowdsourcing evaluation, where we ask
        crowdworkers to assess the relevance of the top-ranked news
        articles w.r.t the event <em>e</em>.</p>
        <p>For our crowdsourcing evaluation, we pick only workers
        of highest quality as identified by the CrowdFlower
        platform<a class="fn" href="#fn8" id=
        "foot-fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>. To the crowdworkers we show
        the description of the event <em>e</em>, and for each
        unlabeled news article, we show a corresponding news
        article that existing in our Wikipedia ground-truth. We
        randomize the order of news articles such that we do not
        exhibit any choice bias from the way the news articles are
        displayed in the crowdsourcing job. For each pair of news
        articles for an event, we ask a total of three crowdworkers
        to assess the relevance of both articles w.r.t the event
        and are provided with the following options: (i) first
        document is relevant, (ii) second document is relevant,
        (iii) both documents are relevant, and (iv) none of the
        documents are relevant. Finally, we pick the label chosen
        based on majority voting principle. Figure&nbsp;<a class=

        crowdsourcing evaluation setting.</p>

        the information from <em>n</em> is reflected in <em>a</em>.
        Hence, a positive <em>Î”</em> value indicates a reduction of

        <p>Apart from the accuracy in suggesting news to Wikipedia
        articles, an important factor is the speed with which such
        news are suggested. In our event-based news suggestion, we
        ensure that an article for an event <em>e</em> is suggested
        as soon as the main criteria established in
        Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-7">3.2</a> are
        fulfilled.</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that in our event collection, we deal
        with highly popular events and Wikipedia articles, we are
        able to suggest significantly faster the news articles to
        Wikipedia articles in comparison to the time in which they
        are added by the Wikipedia editors. Figure&nbsp;<a class=
        "fig" href="#fig4">4</a> shows the amount of days we reduce
        the lag between the publication time of an news article and
        its suggestion into the Wikipedia article. In the figure we
        show the impact on considering suggestions at different
        cut-off points in our topâ€“<em>k</em> ranking of news
        articles. On average, we are able to reduce the lag by four
        days (based on the CrowdGT ground-truth).</p>

        having a specific amount of lag grouped at different
        granularities across different years in Wikipedia. We see
        that there is a tendency of the lag being reduced across
        the years, however, the majority of Wikipedia articles, for
        news articles published in 2016, have a lag between 3 and 6
        months.</p>

      </header>
      <p>In this work, we proposed an event-based news suggestion
      approach from news-streams for Wikipedia articles. For an
      event, which in our case was an entry in the Wikipedia
      currents event portal, we construct an event-chain spanning
      across many days, we observe and decide to suggest when news
      articles w.r.t an event fulfill two main criteria as
      established by Wikipedia policies for suggestion: (i)
      relevance to a Wikipedia article, and (ii) reported by
      authoritative news media.</p>
      <p>We show that our event-chaining approach is highly
      accurate, and furthermore through our L2R approach we can
      suggest with high accuracy news articles relevant for an
      event <em>e</em> and involved Wikipedia articles
      <em>a</em>(<em>e</em>), with <em>P</em>@<em>k</em> = 0.82 and
      <em>MAP</em> = 0.77. Through our accurate suggestion, we can
      reduce the amount of lag between the publication time of a
      relevant news article and the time it is added into the
      corresponding Wikipedia articles. For our set of highly
      popular events, and popular Wikipedia articles, we reduce the
      lag on average of four days when compared to the existing
      state in Wikipedia.</p>
      <p>As future work we foresee, the process of automatically
      distinguishing news articles from a news-stream into separate
      events, thus, making it unnecessary to provide events of
      interest, in this case events from Wikipedia's current event
      portal, which does not have complete coverage of events that
      are reported in news streams like the one indexed by the
      GDelt project.</p>
