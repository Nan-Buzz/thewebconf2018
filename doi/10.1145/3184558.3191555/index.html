        <p><small>Permissioned distributed ledgers (permissioned
        blockchains) supporting smart contracts that automatically
        adjust accounts and coordinate records among multiple
        parties, present a valid platform opportunity for
        establishing a fully digital tax regime. We propose a
        permissioned blockchain-based system aimed at eliminating
        some of the losses that tax authorities globally are
        currently struggling with. These multi-billion flaws
        manifest themselves as the tax gap, or the inability to

        particular authority. Illegitimate or inefficient tax
        operations could be prevented with a global suite of smart

        vision for a VAT Invoice 2.0 modelled as a Linked Data

          Introduction</h2>

      </header>
      <p>Distributed ledgers, also known as blockchains, provide
      decentralised, tamper-free registries of transactions among
      partners that distrust each other. Blockchain platforms keep
      permanent and unchangeable records of transactions between
      multiple parties, whilst also enabling those parties to run
      smart contracts, which can be thought of as self-executing
      agreements that do not need a centralised third party to
      verify [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>].</p>
      <p>In 2015, the World Economic Forum survey found that 73.1%
      respondents expected tax authorities globally to have begun
      collecting taxes via blockchain by the year 2023 [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>]. As of
      today, global taxation systems lack operational efficiency
      when dealing with complex transactions, leading to loopholes
      that create billion-dollar losses every year [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. These losses are
      generally suffered by nation states as opposed to corporate
      entities. Most consultancies have already launched research
      into how blockchains could improve the tax system [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>] and

      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>].</p>
      <p>Although the use of distributed ledgers has been
      researched in many fields such as financial markets, banking
      and land registry services, its application in the fields of
      accounting, audit and taxation remains
      under-explored[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

      <p>There are multiple inefficiencies in tax systems globally,
      but for the purpose of this paper, we shall focus on the
      <em>tax gap</em>, and some of the main factors contributing
      to it, such as tax avoidance or the issue of dishonest tax
      refund applications. The <em>tax gap,</em> [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>] which most commonly
      manifests itself as the <em>VAT gap</em>, is the difference
      between the amount of tax (normally VAT) that is owed by
      taxable entities (normally corporations) to a particular tax
      authority (for example, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs)
      and the amount that actually gets collected. What gets
      collected is typically much less than anticipated - in the
      United Kingdom, the tax gap is in the order of billions of
      pounds [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>].
      The official UK figure for the year 2017, as estimated by HM
      Revenue and Customs, is 34 billion pounds [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>].</p>
      <p>Tax avoidance is believed to be an important contributor
      to tax gaps around the world [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>], as corporations have an incentive to
      manipulate their local books to gain a tax advantage
      globally. In the case of multinational corporations, it is
      particularly difficult to prove how a profit can be ”created”
      in any particular country, given the complex flow of
      commercial internal and external transactions that cross
      borders, and the difficulty in coordinating the flow of
      information between different states’ tax systems. Tax
      avoidance often involves contrived transactions that serve
      little purpose other than to generate a tax advantage. How
      much is lost to this practice is very difficult to measure
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>].
      Nevertheless, certain tax avoidance techniques have been
      receiving more research attention than others; in particular,
      BEPS (<em>base erosion and profit shifting</em> [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]), which is
      a strategy that exploits mismatches in tax rules to
      artificially transfer taxable profits to low tax locations
      where there is little actual economic activity.</p>
      <p>As of 2018, there is still no global information system
      dedicated to managing the cross-border information flow in
      order to reliably check which economic activities have
      originated in which country[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. There currently only exist local, or
      federated solutions to this problem, and those solutions
      typically operate on the basis of centralised data. In the
      European Union, for example, the VAT information exchange
      system (VIES) is a database solution to cross-border VAT
      inefficiencies. It is based around multiple centralised data
      centers that are linked through semiautomatic (frequently
      manual) data exchange processes [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. These manual processes can cause
      many operational issues, for example, if more than two
      traders participate in a <em>chain transaction</em><a class=
      "fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> (eg. a baker
      in Austria buys flour in Poland, and uses it to bake cakes
      that are later sold in Germany), certain conditions must be
      checked in the home countries of all participating entities.
      The lack of transparency and the complexity of those manual
      processes could be alleviated by employing a globally-enabled
      permissioned blockchain to automate them. We explain our
      vision in more detail in the following sections.</p>

      <p>One of the core advantages of a distributed ledger over a
      database is that it helps avoid replication errors [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>] and delays
      when dealing with a huge number of parties. Blockchains are
      also superior for preventing forgeries and disabling
      unauthorised reversals of transactions.</p>
      <p>Certain countries’ tax authorities are currently exploring
      the use of blockchain technology to combat taxation fraud by
      tracing and matching data and improving reporting. The Danish
      Maritime Authority has launched a pilot project to register
      ships via a distributed ledger, to ensure the integrity of
      all relevant tax payments [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]. UK and Australian governments are
      already conducting comprehensive reviews to examine
      blockchain's potential for a range of government
      services<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id=

            Permissioned vs. Permissionless</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>In a ”permissionless” distributed ledger such as the
        Ethereum platform, or the original blockchain underpinning
        Bitcoin, anyone can operate a node and participate in the
        chain through investing their CPU cycles. In our use case,
        the reliance on heavy computation to create trust is not
        just redundant (as tax authorities inherently possess trust
        which has been created in a legal albeit non-computational
        manner) but also prohibitively expensive. In a
        sophisticated blockchain use case like the one we describe
        in this paper, the advantage of the
        <strong>permissioned</strong> mode in terms of cost and
        throughput becomes tangible. In the permissioned model, the
        platform controls who is allowed to participate in the
        validation processes and in the protocol itself.
        Permissioned blockchains have a stronger notion of
        <em>identity</em> that can be managed by use of
        certificates. Furthermore, they allow grouping users
        according to a particular consortium, where trust is
        ”transferred” from real-world trusted entities, such as
        government agencies and tax authorities.</p>

            Hyperledger: Fabric and Sawtooth</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Hyperledger Fabric <a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
        "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> is an implementation of a
        permissioned distributed ledger platform, running smart
        contracts, on top of a modular pluggable architecture. The
        distributed ledger of the fabric is run as a peer-to-peer
        protocol. The blockchain supports two kinds of peers: a
        validating peer responsible for running consensus and
        maintaining the ledger; and a non-validating peer that
        functions as a proxy to connect clients. Some key features
        of Fabric are:</p>
        <p>- it is a permissioned blockchain with immediate
        finality;</p>
        <p>- runs arbitrary smart contracts (called chaincode);</p>
        <p>- user code becomes encapsulated in Docker
        containers;</p>
        <p>- pluggable consensus protocol;</p>
        <p>- supports certificate authorities (CAs) for identity
        management;</p>
        <p>- supports transaction certificates;</p>
        <p>- persistent state using a key-value store
        interface;</p>
        <p>- an event framework that supports pre-defined and
        custom events;</p>
        <p>- a client SDK (Node.js) to interface with the
        fabric;</p>
        <p>- support for REST APIs and CLIs. Hyperledger
        Sawtooth<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id=
        "foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> is much newer and was released
        at the time of writing this paper. It shares many
        capabilities with its Fabric predecessor, whilst also
        implementing the following:</p>
        <p>- On-chain governance: smart contracts can be used to
        vote on blockchain configuration settings such as roles and
        permissions;</p>
        <p>- Ethereum compatibility: solidity code can be deployed
        and executed on Sawtooth;</p>
        <p>- Broader language support:smart contracts can be
        programmed in Go, JavaScript and Python.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">4</span> The ”Holy
          Grail” for tax</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>For the taxation use case, a permissioned blockchain seems
      to be an essential requirement. Hyperledger Sawtooth, as
      outlined in the previous section, appears superior due to its
      on-chain governance features, that could be used to replicate
      real-world taxation governance structures and processes.</p>
      <p>Managing bodies could use Sawtooth to ensure roles and
      permissions, ultimately setting up data access so that only
      participants that are party to a transaction can see
      sensitive details, a feature deemed necessary given the legal
      frameworks within which tax is assessed and collected. Smart
      contracts would be used to automatically synchronise data in
      real time between tax authorities in different countries.</p>
      <p>This set-up is sometimes called a <em>consortium
      blockchain</em>. Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum,
      defines a consortium blockchain as ”a hybrid between the low
      trust provided by public blockchains and the single
      highly-trusted entity model of private blockchains, whereas
      the latter can be more accurately described as a traditional
      centralised system with a degree of cryptographic
      auditability attached”[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]. The use of a modular system like
      Sawtooth would allow each country belonging to the global tax
      ”consortium” to preserve their own taxation rules on the
      local level, whilst making it much easier to synchronise
      relevant tax information globally.</p>
      <p>The authority and trust created outside of the networks
      ensures that participants trust what is committed to the
      ledger, whilst virtually all of the logistical issues
      associated with creating trust artificially (cost, speed,
      throughput and contract complexity) disappear.</p>
      <p>In the case of the European Union, migrating from a
      central database, like VIES, to a consortium of multiple
      countries, running smart contracts on top of a permissioned
      blockchain, achieves the following beneficial outcomes:</p>
      <p>1. Removing a single point of failure for the whole
      system.</p>
      <p>2. Removing incentives for corruption by de-centralising
      power.</p>
      <p>3. Avoiding replication errors and delays when dealing
      with a huge number of parties globally.</p>
      <p>4. Preventing forgeries through the use of
      cryptography.</p>
      <p>5. Disabling unauthorised reversals of transactions.</p>
      <p>6. Providing a decentralised gateway for auditability.</p>
      <p>7. Finally, assuming a modern robust legal framework that
      recognises blockchain data as belonging to a ”universal
      jurisdiction” with its own visionary dispute resolution
      layer, the flow of confidential data between different
      jurisdictions would be much simplified.</p>
      <p>Such a system would help close the tax gap through
      tackling BEPS, it could also help tackle many other ailments
      of the current tax regime. A good example would be chain
      transactions discussed earlier. Another example would be
      tackling an applicant's eligibility for a tax rebate.
      Illegitimate tax compensations are a challenge to trace.
      Although many countries globally have implemented double
      taxation treaties, these laws have not been matched with the
      right infrastructure to exchange information between tax
      authorities[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>].
      Authorities would benefit from a permissioned consortium
      blockchain to improve the data flow when managing duplicate
      cross-border claims.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this section is to outline how a working
        solution would need to implement Linked Data principles to
        provide large scale integration of, and reasoning on, tax
        data. Ontologies (vocabularies) define the concepts and
        relationships of a particular domain [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]. They are useful for
        structuring and indexing information, and making data
        inter-operable[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. Essentially, they help building
        knowledge and foster the understanding of the domain.</p>
        <p>Modelling the tax code has historically posed a
        challenge to information scientists [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>] due to the complexity
        of the domain, spanning countless industries across
        hundreds of countries worldwide. Nevertheless, there have
        been multiple ontologies proposed for describing various
        tax regimes around the globe. The earliest such effort can
        be found in the TAXMAN model by McCarty [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>] in the 1970s.</p>

        <p>Recently, a TKA (Tax Knowledge Adventure) ontology has
        been proposed [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>], based around the 2007 LKIF Core
        ontology of basic legal concepts [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]. This ontology, a
        fragment of which we illustrate in Figure <a class="fig"
        href="#fig1">1</a>, models essential legal concepts such as
        the notion of <em>obligation</em> and
        <em>permission</em>.</p>
        <p>In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], Glaser proposes an ontology for
        decentralising technology infrastructure using blockchain
        systems. The framework provides cross-disciplinary
        researchers with an organised knowledge base and a common
        language describing the terms, concepts and their
        relationships within the blockchain domain.</p>
        <p>By combining an LKIF-based tax ontology with a
        Glaser-based blockchain ontology, we could arrive in the
        future at a new type of vocabulary best suited for our use
        case.</p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">4.2</span> The VAT
            Invoice 2.0</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The invoice is the most essential tax document. We
        propose that every valid tax document be modelled as a
        Linked Data document, built using an ontology discussed in
        the previous subsection, and tagged with a digital
        identifier generated by a smart contract. The provenance,
        traceability and transparency of transactions is then
        achieved. Assuming the use of Hyperledger Sawtooth, set up
        as discussed above, we could generate a set of APIs that
        provide taxation support. A mobile phone connected to the
        Internet could be all that is needed to scan a tax document
        and quickly resolve the list of all transactions from the
        VAT Invoice 2.0. By using unique tax references, we could
        immediately investigate the entire commercial chain for any
        taxable item on a tax document.</p>
        <p>The client could potentially reuse the open-source
        Hyperledger Explorer<a class="fn" href="#fn5" id=
        "foot-fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> which is a powerful blockchain
        module and one of the Hyperledger projects. Designed as a
        user-friendly Web application, the Explorer can view,
        invoke, deploy or query blocks, transactions and associated
        data, network information and transaction families.</p>
        <p>This proposal could trivially solve the problem of
        falsified or mismatching VAT documents, which would provide
        value between customers and businesses. Using a smart
        contract, it would be easy to check whether the version of
        a VAT invoice presented by the customer and stored in his
        or her personal data store matches the version stored in
        the data store of the company who issued the original
        invoice.</p>
        <p>This would also be the essential first step towards
        solving more complex tax anomalies such as BEPS or
        illegitimate refund claims. By combining the Vat Invoice
        2.0 with provenance information about products and
        services, we would have a way of tracing where each product
        and service originated, and by using appropriate tax rules
        for each product and service, we could establish where
        profit was actually created, eg. by using a SPARQL
        query.</p>

        <p>The blockchain community is well aware of the fact that
        without interoperability and standards, it will be
        difficult for any solutions to truly gain traction within
        established industries. The rapid establishment of multiple
        consortiums to examine governance and standards in
        Blockchain development are evidence that efforts towards
        this goal are underway. ISO/TC 307 <a class="fn" href=
        "#fn6" id="foot-fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> is the official ISO
        code for the standardisation of distributed ledger
        technologies. There are currently 6 standards being
        discussed to normalise terminology, privacy, security,
        identity, reference architecture and ontology. These
        efforts are all in early stages.</p>

            Privacy</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>There is an inherent trade-off between privacy, which is
        required by many legal frameworks, and transparency, which
        is a design principle of distributed ledgers. In the
        context of European Union, the General Data Protection
        Regulation, issued in 2016, requires an in-depth
        investigation by legal experts on how it should apply to
        distributed ledgers. A better understanding is needed on
        what constitutes personal and personally identifiable
        information on a blockchain, and what protection mechanisms
        are required.</p>

            Reversibility and Dispute Resolution</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>By default, all transactions on blockchains are final,
        which is a desirable design principle, guaranteeing trust
        through non-repudiation. Nevertheless, mistakes are bound
        to happen when dealing with commercial transactions,
        disputes and refunds. A layer needs to be provided on top
        of distributed ledger data to manage conflicting edits, or
        when a party challenges an established record. This could
        be achieved, for example, through a simple protocol with
        the following rules:</p>
        <p>1. Data cannot be deleted (by blockchain principle).</p>
        <p>2. Data can only be inserted in a [Timestamp, Key,
        Value] format.</p>
        <p>3. Data can only be inserted through an authorised
        open-source smart contract.</p>
        <p>4. The inserting smart contract checks if an older value
        exists for the same key. If false, data is added. If true,
        a dispute resolution contract is called.</p>
        <p>5. Data can only be retrieved through an authorised
        open-source smart contract.</p>
        <p>6. The retrieval smart contract always returns the
        newest value for a particular key.</p>
        <p>If implemented properly, a dispute resolution protocol
        could add value between businesses and governments by
        facilitating non-judicial conflict solving and offloading
        traditional legal systems.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">6</span> Conclusion</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Core attributes of blockchains point towards the
      significant potential for use in tax. We make our case that
      only permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger Sawtooth
      are valid for this use case, as access is restricted to
      identifiable parties, and trust is bootstrapped from legally
      established authorities.</p>
      <p>While distributed ledgers are not the cure-all for tax
      systems, they could be applied in a number of areas to reduce
      the administrative burden and collect tax at a lower cost,
      helping to narrow the tax gap and minimise fraud. Many
      governments and consultancies are already exploring this
      space. We argue that blockchains could add value between
      businesses, between businesses and consumers, and between
      businesses and governments. There is a need for
      experimentation as well as further research into the societal
      implications of blockchains and the changes brought by the
      use cases such as the one discussed in this paper.</p>
      <p>There exist a couple of open problems that need to be
      solved in order to realise the vision for a distributed
      ledger tax regime and the VAT Invoice 2.0. Distributed ledger
      terminology, privacy, security, identity, reference
      architecture and ontology need to be standardised. More work
      is needed to understand what constitutes personal data and
      personally identifiable information on a blockchain, and
      protocols need to be developed for resolving disputes.</p>
