        <p><small>The era of live-broadcast is back but with two
        major changes. First, unlike traditional TV broadcasts,
        content is now streamed over the Internet enabling it to
        reach a&nbsp;<em>wider</em> audience. Second, due to
        various user-generated content platforms it has become
        possible for&nbsp;<em>anyone</em> to get involved,
        streaming their own content to the world. This emerging
        trend of <em>going live</em> usually happens via social
        platforms, where users perform live social broadcasts
        predominantly from their mobile devices, allowing their
        friends (and the general public) to engage with the stream
        in real-time. With the growing popularity of such
        platforms, the burden on the current Internet
        infrastructure is therefore expected to multiply. With this
        in mind, we explore one such prominent platform — Facebook
        Live. We gather 3TB of data, representing one month of
        global activity and explore the characteristics of live
        social broadcast. From this, we derive simple yet effective
        principles which can decrease the network burden. We then
        dissect global and hyper-local properties of the video
        while on-air, by capturing the geography of the
        broadcasters or the users who produce the video and the
        viewers or the users who interact with it. Finally, we
        study the social engagement while the video is live and
        distinguish the key aspects when the same video goes
        on-demand. A common theme throughout the paper is that,
        despite its name, many attributes of Facebook Live deviate
        from both the concepts of <em>live</em> and
        <em>broadcast</em>.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The online sharing of user-generated content is now a
      day-to-day activity for many users around the
      world&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>].
      Whereas traditionally this has followed a “static” upload
      model (where users create a video offline, and then upload
      their content on a platform like YouTube for on-demand
      viewing), recent years have seen a noticeable shift towards
      live equivalents. Mobile applications such as Facebook Live,
      Periscope and Instagram Live allow users to easily broadcast
      their activities to a potentially global audience. We term
      this medium <em>social live broadcast</em>, and distinguish
      it from more traditional forms of live streaming such as
      Twitch, which are not based on social platforms and are not
      impacted by the various cultural and demographic implications
      of a social graph-based delivery.</p>
      <p>One prominent example of live social broadcast is
      <em>Facebook Live</em>. The platform is simple: it allows any
      Facebook user to “go live” and stream their mobile camera
      feed to friends (and others if public). An interesting twist
      is that the video optionally remains available after the
      broadcast, to be viewed on-demand, thus offering
      functionality similar to traditional user-generated platforms
      like YouTube. From a user behaviour perspective, Facebook
      Live is a particularly powerful platform due to the presence
      of both amateur and professional users, and the combination
      of live and non-live video delivery. Further, with a strong
      social network and a global reach, Facebook allows us to
      extract social features and geographical patterns. From an
      infrastructural perspective, it also opens up several
      challenges and opportunities, <em>e.g.,</em> to exploit
      social localities for edge caching.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we make two broad contributions. First, we
      characterise user behaviour in mobile live social broadcast.
      Second, where appropriate, we highlight relevant implications
      for mobile live social video delivery derived from our
      observations. To this end, we have collected a large-scale
      dataset covering one month of activity on Facebook Live. This
      dataset not only encompasses information regarding access
      patterns, but also geographical indicators on where
      broadcasters and viewers are located. To the best of our
      knowledge, we are the first to study Facebook Live and,
      importantly, the first to derive key systems insights.
      Whereas the limited body of past research has focussed on
      performance aspects&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>], we strive to understand its end
      user characteristics, as well as how this might create
      architectural design opportunities.</p>
      <p>We begin by characterising broadcaster and viewer
      properties (§<a class="sec" href="#sec-10">4</a>). We
      quantify Facebook Live's popularity, observing 3.2 million
      accounts performing broadcasts, with a peak of 62 million
      online viewers (§<a class="sec" href="#sec-11">4.1</a>). We
      identify three types of broadcasts. The majority (95%) are
      from social users on Facebook's mobile app, whilst the
      minority are from Facebook page accounts (4%) and
      applications using Facebook's third party API (1%). Although
      social users typically perform short broadcasts, we find a
      non-negligible number of mobile users with broadcast sessions
      exceeding one hour (§<a class="sec" href="#sec-12">4.2</a>).
      However, nearly half of these streams go unwatched, even for
      regular broadcasters. Despite this, we find that the Facebook
      app uploads all content regardless of viewers, wasting user
      device battery and network resources. We therefore propose a
      simple scheme, whereby content is locally cached on a device
      until viewers arrive. We find that 21.91% (21.33TB) of data
      could be offloaded from delivery through this simple
      innovation (§<a class="sec" href="#sec-13">4.3</a>).</p>
      <p>We then dissect the geographical patterns of both
      broadcasters and viewers (§<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-14">5</a>). We confirm that Facebook Live has a global
      reach (§<a class="sec" href="#sec-15">5.1</a>). The majority
      of popular broadcasters are based in Europe, South East Asia,
      Brazil and the East Coast of the United States. Driven by
      social properties, most broadcasts are highly localised. For
      example, 8% of viewers are within a city-level radius of 25KM
      from the broadcaster, accounting for 1.57M viewers. That
      said, we also observe a significant proportion of
      international consumption too (overall, 39.8% of viewers are
      domestic and the remaining are international). There are some
      distinct power players here. For example, residents in the
      United States stream a disproportionate amount of broadcasts
      to Mexico and Canada. This highlights well the social
      properties of Facebook Live, whereby users tend to consume
      directly from friends (who may be in different countries due
      to immigration).</p>
      <p>Finally, we refocus our attention on user engagement
      (§<a class="sec" href="#sec-18">6</a>). We find that popular
      broadcasts consistently garner views rapidly. However, this
      is not the norm — the median view count typically remains
      below 10 throughout the entire duration of streams. We also
      compare this against archived on-demand videos,
      <em>i.e.,</em> streams that were live but subsequently made
      available for later viewing. We find that, in fact, most
      engagement (comments, likes, shares) happen <em>after</em> a
      stream has been archived, thereby demoting the importance of
      the live component. We finally combine the above observations
      to question to what extent Facebook Live is truly live,
      social and broadcasting (§<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-21">7</a>).</p>

      <p><strong>Online Video Delivery:</strong> Our work overlaps
      with studies looking at user generated (UGC) video platforms,
      <em>e.g.,</em> &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>]. These include user behaviour
      analysis&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>] to understand consumption
      patterns&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. Facebook Live departs from the
      traditional UGC model of interaction, with users live
      broadcasting through their mobile device and online social
      network (rather than simply uploading videos). This allows
      for a number of new lines of exploration, particularly
      relating to how <em>live</em> videos are created and consumed
      by social ties. There have been a small number of studies
      into live streaming platforms, including
      Akamai&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>],
      BBC iPlayer&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>] or CNLive&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. These professional
      platforms serve a wide range of international and
      professional content, although we emphasise that this differs
      dramatically from the user generated content discussed above.
      Perhaps the most famous user generated live streaming
      platform of the day is Twitch, which has seen increasing
      research attention&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. This streams live computer
      gameplay, but differs from Facebook Live in that it is not
      mobile, nor integrated within a social network.</p>
      <p><strong>Geographical Video Access Patterns:</strong>
      Another major part of our work is investigating the
      geographical properties of social broadcast and consumption.
      There have been a small set of studies looking at the
      geographical properties of video access. Li <em>et al.</em>
      &nbsp; looked at the the location of viewers watching PPTV in
      China&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>].
      They found that a significant portion of videos get at least
      70% of their views from just 3 out of 33 provincial
      locations. Similar studies have been performed for YouTube,
      finding that users tend to access videos nearby to
      them&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>].
      Whereas studies have been done looking at spatial localities
      in Facebook&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>] and Twitter&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>], this has not inspected
      broadcasts. Interestingly, the integration of live social
      broadcast with a platform like Facebook also conflates two
      factors impacting spatial access patterns:
      (<em>i</em>)&nbsp;Content locality, which is the propensity
      for content generated nearby to be more relevant to a user;
      and (<em>ii</em>)&nbsp;Social locality, which is the
      propensity of content generated by friends to be more
      relevant.</p>
      <p><strong>Social Live Broadcasts:</strong> We take
      inspiration from the above works, but emphasise <em>social
      live broadcasts platforms</em> such as Facebook Live and
      Periscope&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>] are distinct from these systems in a
      number of ways. They allow any user to broadcast themselves
      (usually from a mobile device) to their friends and possibly
      other interested parties. Unlike traditional user-generated
      video platforms, live social streaming drives consumption in
      realtime. Critically, this is done through direct integration
      with a social network, notifying online users of the
      broadcast. This throws up interesting questions that do not
      emerge in past studies on live platforms. For example, we
      later explore the social interactions between viewers and
      broadcasters in real time. Beyond this, the unique social API
      of Facebook Live allows us to dive into questions regarding
      user locations to understand their impact on content creation
      and consumption.</p>
      <p>To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study
      Facebook Live at scale; thus, intentionally, we strive to
      offer a broad characterisation covering the key novel aspects
      of the system. There are, however, a small number of studies
      on related social live streaming platforms. Wang <em>et
      al.</em> studied Periscope from an infrastructural
      perspective&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>], focussing on understanding how
      Periscope scales up. This focussed on popular streams,
      whereas we also focus on the behaviour of unpopular streams
      (which are more frequently occurring). We also integrate this
      with exploration of geographical and social properties of the
      broadcasters. A related paper&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>] inspected Periscope to
      capture performance metrics, <em>e.g.,</em> video quality,
      stall events, power consumption. Tang <em>et al.</em>
      focussed on a small set of Meerkat and Periscope broadcasts
      using crowd sourced analysis and interviews; they focussed on
      things like motivation for usage&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>]. This social analysis,
      however, was based on just 767 (manually analysed) live
      broadcasts. The focus of our paper is very different. We take
      a user-facing perspective, empirically exploring the ways
      users interact with Facebook Live on both a global and
      regional level. Although we do this at scale, we also focus
      on both highly popular and unpopular users to understand
      system implications for both.</p>

        </header>
        <p>We have written a crawler that automatically collects
        information on publicly accessible Facebook broadcasts.
        These are taken from the Facebook Live map,<a class="fn"
        href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> which publishes
        broadcasts in realtime. The crawler collects this data
        every two minutes, providing a periodic snapshot of all
        geo-tagged public streams in the system (including their
        metadata). This was executed between 7-Nov-2016 and
        2-Dec-2016, resulting in 3TB of data.<a class="fn" href=
        "#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> This covered 6.5
        million broadcasts by 3.29 million unique broadcasters, and
        viewed by a peak of 62 million users. Amongst several
        events captured, our dataset covered the US Presidential
        election of Nov 2016, Thanksgiving (26th November) and
        Armistice Day (11th November).</p>
        <p>On Facebook Live, a broadcaster can go live using any of
        the following three mechanisms:
        (<em>i</em>)&nbsp;<strong>From App</strong>: Users or pages
        can create live streams using the Facebook App or Facebook
        Mentions<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
        "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> from their Android or iOS
        devices. Note that the feature of going live from the
        browser was introduced three months after the
        crawl.<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id=
        "foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> (<em>ii</em>)&nbsp;<strong>From
        Publisher tools</strong><a class="fn" href="#fn5" id=
        "foot-fn5"><sup>5</sup></a>: Facebook Pages<a class="fn"
        href="#fn6" id="foot-fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> can use this
        feature allowing them to use any external device or
        software to stream the live content.
        (<em>iii</em>)&nbsp;<strong>Using Developer API</strong>:
        Developers can use the live API<a class="fn" href="#fn7"
        id="foot-fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> and embed it in their app to
        broadcast their content through Facebook. 95%, 4% and &lt;
        1% of broadcasts belong to each of these above category
        respectively.</p>
        <p>For every broadcast, the following data is collected
        every two minutes: (<em>i</em>)&nbsp;<strong>Broadcaster
        metadata</strong>: The broadcaster's username and the
        geo-tag coordinates (<em>cf.</em> §<a class="sec" href=
        "#sec-8">3.2</a>). The broadcaster can be either an
        individual user account or, alternatively, a Facebook Page
        (typically created for organisations, <em>e.g.,</em>
        political parties). In the latter case, we also collect
        information about the category of the broadcast page,
        <em>e.g.,</em> Media, Sport, Shopping <em>etc.</em>
        Geo-tags are added by the user based on their GPS
        coordinates; if a user does not share location information
        explicitly, any publicly accessible location information in
        their profile will be used.
        (<em>ii</em>)&nbsp;<strong>Viewer information</strong>: The
        number of live viewers per broadcast, as well as the
        location coordinates of the viewers (returned by
        Facebook).</p>
        <p>Engagement attributes are also collected, namely the
        number of likes, shares and comments during the broadcast.
        After eight months we then revisited any videos that had
        been archived for later on-demand access, collecting the
        number of likes, shares, comments and the bitrate (46.1% of
        live streams were archived). Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl"
        href="#tab1">1</a> provides a summary of the dataset across
        different regions.</p>
        <p>To give context regarding the <em>types</em> of content
        material, we briefly inspect the categorical tags within
        the Page broadcasts. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig1">1</a> presents the fraction of broadcasts that fall
        into each category, as well as the fraction of the overall
        viewership that each category attracts. Media, which covers
        things like news and TV content, gains by far the highest
        viewership (over 50%), despite constituting less than 20%
        of broadcasts. “Religious Place of Worship” is second most
        popular by the number of broadcasters, driven by the US and
        Brazil where they constitute over 30% of the streams.
        Measuring across the world, however, 40% of the religious
        broadcasts do not garner even a single view. Other content
        types ranging from arts to shopping can be seen of assorted
        popularities.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>As stated above, we collect geo-coordinates for viewers
        and broadcasters. These are used by Facebook to visualise
        locations on a public map for users. Before continuing, it
        is important to validate the fidelity of these coordinates
        and explain the level of sampling Facebook utilises when
        returning locations of viewers. Every broadcast is
        accompanied by a longitude-latitude pair from where the
        broadcast happens and the viewer locations are reported for
        the broadcasts that have greater than 100 views.</p>
        <p><em>All</em> the broadcasters have geo-tags, whilst the
        mean percentage of viewers that also have locations
        reported is 55%, with a standard deviation of 12.83. We
        regularly observe broadcasters reporting multiple locations
        per broadcast (this could be because the user has moved or
        because Facebook has introduced noise to protect the
        location privacy of broadcasters). To explore this, for
        each broadcast, we take all reported coordinates for the
        broadcaster and compute the centroid. We then calculate the
        maximum distance between the centroid and all
        geo-co-ordinates reported — this gives the upper bound of
        any noise potentially introduced. Figure&nbsp;<a class=
        "fig" href="#fig2">2</a> presents a Cumulative Distribution
        Function (CDF) of the results. We find that <em>no</em>
        broadcaster reports a distance that varies greater than 7
        KM from the centroid. This indicates that any noise (if
        introduced) will only undermine accuracy by this upper
        bound; this is sufficiently accurate to allow global-scale
        geo analysis. Finally, we convert each geo-coordinate into
        its country of origin using country polygons. For
        subsequent statistics related to distance, we utilise
        Vincenty's formula for computing the distance between
        coordinates&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. When users go live, they are
        redirected to their closest Point of Presence (PoP) using
        RTMPS. Video data is adaptively encoded by the Facebook
        mobile app, and then uploaded to a data centre via the PoP.
        Typically, data is uploaded in a high definition format,
        but quality is degraded in cases of poor connectivity. Any
        users wishing to view the stream downloads a manifest file,
        and begins requesting listed video chunks via Facebook's
        CDN (mainly Akamai), where caching also takes place.</p>

        <p>First, we look at the overall popularity of the
        platform, as measured by the number of broadcasters and
        viewers. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>
        presents an hourly time series across our dataset. It
        counts both the number of broadcasts (Y1-axis) and viewers
        (Y2-axis). We see a roughly stable trend for viewers, but
        erratic trends for broadcasters. This is largely due to a
        high number of broadcasts in November 2016 due to the US
        Presidential elections. We also observe periodic spikes in
        utilisation. These centre on weekends, indicating the
        social nature of the broadcast platform.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>Whereas the above quantifies how popular Facebook Live
        is, it does not demonstrate the popularity of individual
        broadcasters. This is typically a more important metric for
        users wishing to use their broadcasts for promotion.
        Figure&nbsp;4a presents a CDF of the peak view
        counts<a class="fn" href="#fn8" id=
        "foot-fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> for each broadcast. Two lines
        are present: (<em>i</em>)&nbsp;Broadcasts by
        <strong>User</strong> accounts, which are generated by
        individual Facebook users on their mobile device and
        (<em>ii</em>)&nbsp;Broadcasts by <strong>Page</strong>
        accounts, which are generated by Facebook Pages.</p>
        <p>It can be seen that Page broadcasts gain significantly
        more viewers than typical user broadcasts. To add further
        context, Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a>
        presents the Top 10 broadcasters, ranked by peak viewing
        figures. It can be seen that 7 out of the Top 10
        broadcasters are Pages. Even though Page broadcasters only
        contribute 4.26% of the streams, they collect almost 35% of
        all views. In stark contrast, we find that 41.5% of user
        broadcasts <em>never</em> gain a single viewer, whilst
        55.35% of broadcasters have at least one stream that
        remains unwatched. In fact, the median view count for user
        broadcasts is just 1. This raises questions regarding the
        extent that Facebook Live is actually used as a social
        <em>broad</em>cast medium in practice, as opposed to a
        unicast stream that is seen by one or even zero
        viewers.</p>

            count &gt; 1). Broadcasts are separated into those

            user and page videos go unwatched; 9% of user videos
            and 5% of page videos get just a single view. (b) CDF
            of broadcast duration. Broadcasts are separated into

        </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>To study this further, we separate all users into
        buckets based on the total number of broadcasts they have
        performed. For each bucket, we compute the fraction of
        broadcasts that gained 0 viewers, 1 viewer and &gt; 1
        viewers. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a>
        presents our findings as a stacked bar chart; buckets are
        plotted on the X-axis and the fraction of broadcasts with
        zero views is plotted on the Y-axis. We also plot the
        number of samples in each bucket on the Y2-axis.
        Unsurprisingly we find on the Y2-axis that the number of
        broadcasters in each bucket decreases as the threshold for
        number of broadcasts increases. Focusing on the Y1-axis, we
        find, as expected, that the heavy users who broadcast more
        have a lower proportion of unwatched streams. However, we
        observe that <em>all</em> user groups generate unwatched
        material. This extends to users who generate tens of
        broadcasts. This confirms that unwatched material is not
        simply created by experimental users who just “try out”
        Facebook Live once. Instead, it is a persistent
        characteristic of broadcasters. For example, for users with
        10 broadcasts, we find that 29.56% of broadcasts gain 0
        viewers, 7.9% gain 1 viewer and the remainder gain above 1
        viewer. Interestingly, the graph also demonstrates a
        valley-like trend, whereby users with a small number of
        broadcasts largely gain 0 viewers (45.8% for below 5
        broadcasts), whilst users with a high number of
        broadcasters also generate a lot of unwatched streams
        (36.35% for above 100 broadcasts). Users who fall in the
        middle of the spectrum (40–50 broadcasts) have the lowest
        proportion of unwatched material. Although this observation
        is impacted by the smaller sample sizes for user groups
        with large numbers of broadcasts (as shown on the Y2-axis),
        our manual inspection reveals that such “unpopular” users
        tend to generate large numbers of uninteresting material,
        <em>e.g.,</em> unprocessed personal diaries. It should also
        be noted that the generation of unwatched material is not
        exclusive to mobile users; some categories of Page streams
        exhibit similar properties, <em>e.g.,</em> 40% of
        “Religious” streams from Page accounts are never viewed,
        and 13% for “Media” streams. Overall, 37.4% of Page streams
        have zero views.</p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">4.2</span> How long
            are broadcasts?</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The previous section has highlighted that nearly half of
        all user broadcasts are never viewed. We next inspect the
        durations of these broadcasts to understand the resources
        consumed (both in terms of user time and upload volume).
        Figure&nbsp;4b presents a CDF of the duration of broadcasts
        separated into a number of groups. App broadcasts are, by
        far, the longest with 53.46% exceeding half an hour. This
        is largely driven by the fact that most apps broadcast
        computer gameplay. Broadcasts performed by Pages also tend
        to be substantially longer in duration than User
        broadcasts. Almost 30% of the Page broadcasts exceed half
        an hour, compared to just 6% for User broadcasts (where
        77.34% are under 10 minutes).</p>
        <p>This trend may be partly driven by the greater
        popularity of Page streams (<em>cf.</em> Figure&nbsp;4a).
        To examine this more closely for mobile users,
        Figure&nbsp;4a breaks User broadcasts into two groups:
        (<em>i</em>)&nbsp;<strong>Popular</strong>, which gain over
        100 viewers at peak; and
        (<em>ii</em>)&nbsp;<strong>Unpopular</strong>, which are
        never viewed. In-line with our previous statement, we see
        that more popular streams broadcast for longer. 25% of
        these streams last longer than half an hour, whereas this
        is just 2% for unpopular streams. Critically, however, we
        still find a non-negligible number of unwatched streams
        that broadcast for extended periods (80k videos are longer
        than 20 minutes).</p>
        <p>Currently, streams with zero views are live streamed to
        Facebook's infrastructure regardless of their popularity.
        This observation suggests significant waste in network,
        client and server resouces. For example, the average
        duration for unwatched streams is five and a half minutes.
        With a bitrate of 500kbps, this would generate 18MB of
        needless traffic per broadcast (with battery and network
        costs). This therefore raises the question of how such
        content is delivered. Whereas uploads are obviously
        necessary for archived streams (<em>i.e.,</em> ones that
        remain on a user's profile), this is profligate for live
        streams that are not archived. This is because such data is
        immediately discarded without anybody ever seeing it.
        Importantly, we find that only 41.7% of unwatched streams
        are actually archived — for the remainder, it is
        unnecessary to waste device resources in performing the
        live upload to the PoP. This observation leads us to
        inspect the size of the archived videos (<em>i.e.,</em>
        videos marked by the users as being available for on-demand
        viewing later on) to understand the precise volume of this
        upload process. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig4">4c</a> presents the distribution of file sizes for
        all archived videos. The median file size for broadcasts
        with zero views is 8.57 MB, with 45% exceeding 10 MB.</p>

            broadcast really necessary?</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Combining the above observations, we see that Facebook
        Live is predominantly (95%) used by mobile users to
        broadcast content. Pages garner a disproportionate number
        of viewers, whilst 41.47% of user broadcasts languish in
        obscurity, never being viewed. These observations indicate
        that the current “cloud-based” model of delivery is
        misplaced. As it stands, the Facebook mobile app uploads
        content regardless of view counts. This opens up
        interesting opportunities for hyper-local storage. For
        example, video content can be cached locally on the mobile
        device, and only uploaded once the first viewer
        arrives<a class="fn" href="#fn9" id=
        "foot-fn9"><sup>9</sup></a>. Upon the completion of a
        broadcast, users are given the option of archiving the
        content. Live content that is not watched and not archived
        can be cached locally and then discarded after broadcast.
        If the user wishes to archive the video, it can be
        automatically uploaded to Facebook when convenient
        (<em>e.g.,</em> via WiFi). This simple change would reduce
        use of battery and network for the 55.58% of broadcasters
        who (at least once) generate an unwatched video. It would
        also save an average of 5.84MB per upload. Note that this
        also covers broadcasters who generate <em>any</em> video
        chunks that are never watched. For example, 44.1% of
        streams in their first 2 minutes have zero viewers, out of
        which 7.8% continue to garner viewers later. Hence, such
        users need not upload the first chunks until a viewer
        arrives<a class="fn" href="#fn10" id=

      <p>The previous section has highlighted the nature of social
      broadcast, focussing on the large number of unwatched and
      unpopular streams. Next, we inspect the opposite end of the
      spectrum — highly popular streams. A unique aspect of
      Facebook Live is that it provides the locations of stream
      viewers for broadcasts with an audience of 100+. This allows
      us to understand the geographical relationship between
      broadcasters and viewers.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>We begin by inspecting the locations of users to
        understand where Facebook Live's userbase is.
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a> presents
        viewer (blue) and broadcaster (green) locations for any
        streams that garner above 100 viewers. This covers 45K
        broadcasts, and 20.3 million viewers. The map shows a
        significant spread of broadcasters (green) with a focus on
        East Coast US, Brazil, Europe and South East Asia. It can
        be seen that most major conurbations are covered. A
        particularly nice feature of the dataset is that locations
        are based on mobile GPS-based geo-tags (rather than IP
        address). This gives us accurate geographical vantage into
        regions such as China, which typically access Facebook via
        VPN (thereby changing their reported IP geolocation). It
        can be seen that despite the blocking of Facebook, there
        are a number of users in China. In the rest of this
        section, we focus on the top 19 countries measured by
        broadcasters and consumers. These countries are obtained
        taking the union of the top 15 countries in terms of
        broadcasters and top 15 in terms of consumers.</p>
        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a> presents
        the percentage of broadcasters and viewers based in each of
        the top 19 countries. A clear ranking can be observed; the
        US dominates both the number of broadcasters and viewers,
        followed by Thailand and Vietnam. The latter is
        particularly interesting, as in many cases we find that the
        number of viewers and broadcasters in a country do not
        necessarily correlate. For instance, whereas, in the US or
        Brazil, the fraction of viewers and broadcasters is
        relatively <em>similar</em>, Thailand generates a
        significant proportion of the world's broadcasts (11.26%),
        but only constitutes 8% of the viewers. Conversely, in
        Turkey, there are significant fraction of viewers (7.1% of
        the world's viewers), but only 2.94% of broadcasters.
        Similar observations can be made across many other
        countries, including Korea, Peru and Romania. Through
        manual inspection, we find a number of potential reasons.
        For instance, Turkey blocks access to Facebook; therefore,
        most users are likely accessing it via circumvention tools.
        Whereas Turkish users may be keen on consuming content,
        they may be less willing to expose themselves by
        broadcasting on a censored medium. In the case of Thailand,
        we find that a notable portion of adult content is being
        streamed, and this niche content attracts a globally
        distributed viewership (rather than just in Thailand).</p>

        <p>Although the above reveals the locations of broadcasters
        and viewers, it does not show their relationships. From a
        systems-perspective, this is critical for optimising
        delay-<em>in</em>tolerant communications as ideally
        viewers, broadcasters and any intermediate servers would be
        within short distances. Regarding the latter, there have
        been a number of recent proposals regarding the placement
        of servers within cell towers and local network PoPs,
        <em>i.e.,</em> so-called mobile edge
        computing&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>]. Thus, we next inspect the
        distance that viewers are from the broadcasters they watch.
        Figure&nbsp;9a presents CDFs of the distance between
        broadcasters and their viewers for user accounts. We
        separate broadcasters into their respective countries. In
        cases where the distribution plateaus, typically the
        broadcasters and viewers are separated by an ocean
        (<em>e.g.,</em> in the case of Philippines this is the
        distance across the Pacific to reach US-based viewers, who
        constitute 9% of the country's audience).</p>
        <p>It can be seen that a notable subset of broadcasters are
        hyper-local to their consumers. This is shown well in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig8">8</a>, which
        presents a heatmap of viewer locations relative to the
        broadcasater. Overall, 8% of viewers are within 25 KM of
        the broadcaster and constitute a city-level locality. South
        Korea is the most extreme in this regard; 11% of viewers
        are within 25KM, with 4% actually under 5KM. We can also
        inspect the opposite end of the spectrum. 11.35% of viewers
        are over 10,000 KM away from their broadcaster. Here,
        subtle differences can be seen between broadcasters from
        different countries. For example, broadcasters from the
        Philippines, a tiny island in the middle of Western
        Pacific, tend to be further away from their viewers (only
        37.81% of viewers are closer than 1000 KM), whereas Turkish
        broadcasters generally garner more nearby viewers (52.71%
        are closer than 1000 KM). As previously discussed, this
        local content consumption suggests that live social
        streaming would be well placed to benefit from technologies
        such as mobile edge computing.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>It should be remembered that distance can be deceptive
        due to the various sizes of individual countries. Since we
        expect infrastructure to be confined within country
        borders, we next separate all broadcasters and viewers into
        their respective countries. Figure&nbsp;9b presents the
        fraction of the views for videos of a country which come
        from domestic viewers. This is computed as follows: For a
        given country, we take the total view count of all videos
        broadcasted from that country. We then present the
        <em>fraction</em> of these views that are domestic,
        <em>i.e.,</em> from viewers in the same country as the
        broadcaster. In some cases (<em>e.g.,</em> Thailand,
        Vietnam), over 80% of views are domestic, suggesting strong
        language, social and cultural ties drive consumption. In
        other cases, under 20% of viewers are domestic
        (<em>e.g.,</em> Germany). This suggests such countries
        generate highly popular international content. However, we
        note that almost all videos have a non-trivial local
        viewership; and thus would benefit from caching locally in
        the country of broadcast, regardless of whether the video
        also has an international appeal or not.</p>
        <p>To explore the international views,
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig9">9c</a> presents a
        heat map of the <em>non-domestic</em> views. Each cell in
        the matrix represents the fraction of views for videos of a
        country which come from a specific consumer country. For
        the sake of clarity, the fraction of domestic views (where
        the producer and consumer are from the same country) are
        not plotted. Further, only the top 19 producers and
        consumers are shown; thus the fraction of the heat map
        values across all consumers might not add up to 1.</p>
        <p>It can immediately be seen that a small number of
        countries stand-out in regards to the global reach of their
        content. The US is the most prominent, with a particularly
        large build-up of viewers in Mexico and Canada. This is not
        surprising considering the high degrees of immigration and
        cultural overlap between these three countries. Despite our
        prior observation about local consumption, Thailand and
        Vietnam also have a large number of viewers from other
        countries. Much like the US, this is driven by the large
        number of broadcasts in the country.</p>
        <p>Before concluding, we note that Figure&nbsp;<a class=
        "fig" href="#fig9">9c</a> is intended to illustrate some
        interesting international trends and is not a complete
        picture – for instance, countries like Germany and Turkey,
        which have a high proportion of non-domestic views
        (Figure&nbsp;9b) do not show up with high values in this
        heat map because the viewers for the video broadcasts from
        these countries are not amongst the top 15 consumers.</p>

          Engagement</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Our final analysis briefly explores engagement factors. We
      explore the extent to which views, and other social
      engagement measures such as numbers of likes, comments and
      shares evolve over the lifetime of a video, both during the
      live broadcast, as well as afterwards, and draw implications
      for mobile livecasting. The main takeaway is that most of the
      engagement happens <em>after</em> the live broadcast, lending
      further support to the idea that Facebook Live can be treated
      similarly to an on-demand service, as opposed to a live
      broadcast.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>First, we capture the instantaneous number of viewers
        for <em>all</em> broadcasts. We do this until minute 34 (≈
        95% of videos end before 34 minutes). The number of viewers
        depends to some extent on the quality of the video, but
        also upon the duration – longer videos have a higher chance
        of catching friends who come online, and notice the live
        broadcast. Yet, many of them may lose interest and leave
        after some time, so the later minutes of the video may lack
        sufficient viewers. To avoid introducing bias through the
        varying sample size across each time interval bucket, we
        randomly pick 100k videos for each time intervals, and
        study the distribution of viewer counts.</p>

        show the range of the data. Flier points past the end of
        the whiskers are not shown for clarity. The viewer counts
        increase after the first interval, and there is a larger
        variance in the later time buckets, indicating that
        sufficiently interesting longer videos accumulate viewers
        over time. But the median number of viewers remains
        comfortably under 10, even after 20–30 minutes of
        broadcast, again underscoring that it is not very difficult
        to support most live broadcasts.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>A key feature of Facebook Live is the ability for
        viewers to interact with broadcasters. This comes in the
        form of likes, shares and comments. In a sense, this offers
        an alternative measure of popularity when compared to the
        earlier discussion of viewer counts.</p>
        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig11">11</a> presents
        the distribution of these engagement metrics for all
        broadcasts. The figure presents these metrics across three
        time windows: (<em>i</em>)&nbsp;During the live broadcast;
        (<em>ii</em>)&nbsp;a day later for videos that have been
        archived on-demand; and (<em>iii</em>)&nbsp;8 months later.
        The pattern indicates the type of engagement, whilst the
        grayscale colour separates broadcasts into four popularity
        groups – those that get 0 engagement
        (likes/comments/shares), 1–10 engagements, 11–100
        engagements or more than 100 engagements.</p>
        <p>Most of the engagement happens <em>after</em> the live
        broadcast. It is therefore questionable to what extent this
        is a <em>live</em> platform. On average during the live
        broadcast, videos receive 6.7 likes, 8.4 comments and 0.54
        shares. One day after broadcast, the engagement counts jump
        to 29.84 likes, 16.33 comments, and 1.33 shares. These
        numbers do not change much in the next 8 months; thus the
        majority of interaction happens in the 1 day after
        broadcast. Notice that about 40% (47%) of videos collect no
        likes (comments) during the live broadcast, but this number
        drops to 3% (16%) after a day. From an infrastructure
        design perspective, this interaction pattern makes it
        easier to support social engagement, since on-demand is
        easier to manager than live streaming, which requires
        synchronisation of the display of likes and comments across
        all viewers at the point in the stream where the
        interaction happened.</p>
        <p>We note that during the live broadcasts, comments tend
        to outnumber likes, but the engagement after the broadcast
        tends to be through likes. Comments represent a much
        stronger form of engagement; thus we conjecture that users
        who watch and interact with the live stream may be close
        friends of the user, whereas the later engagement could be
        from other friends or the general public.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">7</span> Conclusion,
          Implications and Future Work</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In this paper we explored the usage of Facebook Live in
      terms of three major factors: video characteristics;
      geography of broadcasters and viewers; and the social
      engagement. We began by characterising broadcast behaviour
      (§<a class="sec" href="#sec-10">4</a>). Being a popular
      platform, Facebook Live encounters peaks of 63 million online
      viewers. Despite this, we find that popularity is typically
      reserved for Page accounts and a small set of celebrity
      users. Over half of the social users on Facebook Live
      generate unwatched content at least once, with 41.5% of
      broadcasts never being viewed. This casts doubt over both the
      terms <em>social</em> and <em>broadcast</em> in social live
      broadcast. In response, we proposed a simple mechanism to
      alleviate network and battery consumption. In cases where
      live streams receive no viewers, we proposed locally storing
      the content on the broadcasters’ mobile devices until viewers
      arrive (rather than uploading video chunks that are never
      watched). Although this may introduce a slightly greater
      startup delay from viewers, such a model would reduce the
      number of bytes transferred by 21.9%, and mean that 23.18% of
      videos never need to leave the mobile device (only those that
      are viewed or archived by the broadcasters, allowing
      on-demand access later on, must be uploaded).</p>
      <p>We then proceeded to explore the geographical (§<a class=
      "sec" href="#sec-14">5</a>) properties of the system. Due to
      the social nature of Facebook Live, streams exhibit high
      degrees of locality. 8% of viewers are within 25 KM of the
      broadcaster. We argue that this makes the service well suited
      to many recently proposed mobile edge computing architectures
      (<em>e.g.,</em> &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]). Unsurprisingly, these observations
      also result in clear trends in consumption with most users
      accessing domestic content. Exceptions to this tend to align
      with high levels of cultural and language similarity.
      Finally, we explored viewer engagement (§<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-18">6</a>) to find that even popular streams
      (<em>i.e.,</em> &gt; 10 viewers) have periods of being
      unwatched. We also found that most social engagement actually
      occurs <em>after</em> the live stream for the 46% of streams
      that were archived. This, again, casts doubt over the term
      <em>live</em> in social live broadcast, with Facebook Live
      exhibiting on-demand-style behaviour for many consumers.</p>
      <p>This paper constitutes a key contribution within the
      broader field of mobile social video consumption. However,
      there remains a series of interesting points for exploration.
      We have noted several systems implications from our findings.
      Implementing and evaluating these concepts would be a
      fruitful line of exploration, particularly as many are simple
      and could be easily integrated into social broadcast apps. We
      should note, however, that we anticipate significant growth
      in the use of Facebook Live in the future. Hence, it is
      important to monitor how behaviour evolves to understand the
      long-term applicability of design choices. To date, we have
      also not been able to dive into how the social graph impacts
      video popularity, nor how such data could be used to predict
      and inform delivery strategies. Understanding how social
      topology impacts content consumption would be a clear line of
      future work. We also found that a number of spatial
      properties were correlated; we wish to expand this type of
      correlation analysis to other domains, <em>e.g.,</em>
      understanding if broadcasts correlate with socioeconomic
      metrics or things like tourism and immigration levels from
      other countries. Predictive models for capacity planning
      and/or caching could make great use of such insight.</p>
