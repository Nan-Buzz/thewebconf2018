        <p><small>Mobile health applications, including those that
        track activities such as exercise, sleep, and diet, are
        becoming widely used. Accurately predicting human actions
        in the real world is essential for targeted recommendations
        that could improve our health and for personalization of
        these applications. However, making such predictions is
        extremely difficult due to the complexities of human
        behavior, which consists of a large number of potential
        actions that vary over time, depend on each other, and are
        periodic. Previous work has not jointly modeled these
        dynamics and has largely focused on item consumption
        patterns instead of broader types of behaviors such as
        eating, commuting or exercising.</small></p>
        <p><small>In this work, we develop a novel statistical
        model, called <em>TIPAS</em>, for Time-varying,
        Interdependent, and Periodic Action Sequences. Our approach
        is based on personalized, multivariate temporal point
        processes that model time-varying action propensities
        through a mixture of Gaussian intensities. Our model
        captures short-term and long-term periodic
        interdependencies between actions through Hawkes
        process-based self-excitations. We evaluate our approach on
        two activity logging datasets comprising 12 million
        real-world actions (<em>e.g.</em>, eating, sleep, and
        exercise) taken by 20 thousand users over 17 months. We
        demonstrate that our approach allows us to make successful
        predictions of future user actions and their timing.
        Specifically, TIPAS improves predictions of actions, and
        their timing, over existing methods across multiple
        datasets by up to 156%, and up to 37%, respectively.
        Performance improvements are particularly large for
        relatively rare and periodic actions such as walking and
        biking, improving over baselines by up to 256%. This
        demonstrates that explicit modeling of dependencies and
        periodicities in real-world behavior enables successful
        predictions of future actions, with implications for
        modeling human behavior, app personalization, and targeting
        of health interventions.</small></p>

      <p>Activity tracking applications for mobile health have
      become an important part of people's daily lives. A
      US-nationwide study in 2013 found that 69% of adults keep
      track of a health indicator, and 21% among them used an app
      or device to do so&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]. In activity logging applications
      such as Fitbit, Under Armour Record, and Argus, users might
      take one of many possible actions from a large and diverse
      space of potential actions at any point in time. Users
      continuously track many actions of their lives including
      exercise, diet, sleep, and commuting behavior with the goal
      of improving self-knowledge and personal
      well-being&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0046">46</a>]. User modeling is critical to making
      activity logging applications more useful by providing users
      with personalized experiences matching their specific
      objectives&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0054">54</a>]. This has the potential to
      significantly improve people's health, for instance by
      preventing negative health outcomes and promoting the
      adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>]. However,
      successful personalization of systems rests on the ability to
      predict the user's next actions and when they will
      occur&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0054">54</a>].</p>
      <p>Predicting actions is important because these predictions
      facilitate personalization of the user interface and user
      experience in order to provide users with what they need,
      without them asking for it explicitly&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0041">41</a>]. For example, in activity
      logging applications we can predict when the user will eat
      dinner and their future location in order to provide relevant
      recommendations&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0052">52</a>]. Accurate and contextualized
      predictions could further help users to realize their
      personal goals by reminding them to measure their weight or
      notifying them about the exercise the next
      morning&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0046">46</a>]. Besides predicting the action
      itself, it is also critical to predict its timing, so that
      recommendations and reminders can be made at the right time.
      For instance, diet reminders ideally are delivered just
      <em>before</em> meal choices are made&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>]. More generally,
      predicting user actions also enables digital personal
      assistants that support users with relevant information
      including local recommendations, traffic, weather, events,
      and news&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>].</p>
      <p>However, human behavior is extremely complex, which makes
      accurate predictions very challenging. In particular, human
      behavior is (1) <em>time-varying</em>, (2)
      <em>interdependent</em>, and (3) <em>periodic.</em> First,
      real-world actions <em>vary over time</em>, for example based
      on time of day (<em>e.g.</em>, spending time with friends in
      the evenings) and day of week (<em>e.g.</em>, going hiking on
      weekends)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>]. Second, actions are also
      <em>interdependent</em> in the short-term and the long-term
      (<em>e.g.</em>, brushing teeth before going to bed, or
      drinking water after workouts). Third, humans are creatures
      of habit&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] and exhibit <em>periodic</em>
      behaviors&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>], such as brushing teeth every
      morning and evening.</p>
      <p>Current user modeling techniques
      (<em>e.g.</em>,&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0050">50</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0055">55</a>]) do not jointly model all these key
      aspects (time variation, interdependence, periodicity) of
      real-world action sequences. However, failing to account for
      any of them results in decreased predictive performance. For
      example, consider the task of predicting the time of a user's
      next meal. When not accounting for periodicity, one would
      miss the fact that the user's early lunch might lead to an
      earlier dinner as well. However, this could be a critical
      mistake if the user relies on timely diet reminders.</p>
      <p>While great advances have been made in modeling specific
      aspects of behavior in narrow application domains, in
      particular in the space of recommender
      systems&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>] or information
      retrieval&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>], these lines of work have largely
      focused on consumption of items such as specific videos,
      songs, or websites&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0050">50</a>]. In all these cases, users repeat
      the <em>same</em> high-level actions such as watching one
      video after another. In contrast, we consider predicting
      <em>which</em> higher-level action, out of many, the user
      will take next; for example, whether they will watch a movie
      or go for a run (not which specific movie or run).
      Furthermore, previous work has often focused on predicting
      short-term actions such as the next unix
      command&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>], web page request&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0055">55</a>], or TV
      episode watched&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0050">50</a>]. Instead, we are interested in
      predicting longer-term actions such as a commute in the
      evening or a run the next morning.</p>
      <p><strong>This work.</strong>We present a new model for the
      task of predicting future user actions and their timing.
      First, we empirically demonstrate that action sequences
      exhibit time-varying, interdependent, and periodic patterns
      and that modeling them is critical to accurate predictions of
      user actions. Our model extends prior work on multivariate
      temporal point processes and is the first model to account
      for all three key properties. The model addresses
      (1)&nbsp;time-varying propensities of actions through mixture
      of Gaussians, (2)&nbsp;short-term dependencies between
      actions through a Hawkes process, and (3)&nbsp;long-term
      periodicity with time-dependent Weibull distributions. We
      call this model <em>TIPAS</em> referring to Time-varying
      Interdependent Periodic Action Sequences. TIPAS is
      personalized to each user through learning user-specific
      action preferences. We further develop an EM-based algorithm
      to fit this model using maximum likelihood estimation.</p>
      <p>We demonstrate that TIPAS can scale to real-world datasets
      from Argus and Under Armour activity logging applications
      that capture 12 million actions taken by 20 thousand users
      over 17 months. We evaluate our model on these two activity
      logging datasets capturing ten different real-world actions,
      and demonstrate that we can predict the user's next logged
      activity (<em>e.g.</em>, run, eat, or sleep) and the timing
      of that activity (continuous, non-discretized timestamp)
      based on the user's previous actions and their timing.</p>
      <p>Further, we show that TIPAS accurately captures all three
      fundamental behavioral patterns in real-world data. Using
      several domains of real-world actions, we demonstrate that
      our model outperforms eleven existing approaches on tasks of
      predicting actions by up to 156% as well as predicting when
      they will occur by up to 37%. Further, we show that
      performance improvements over baselines are particularly
      large for rare actions, increasing prediction accuracy over
      baselines by up to 256%. We find that these performance
      improvements are crucially enabled by modeling time-varying
      propensities of actions and their dependencies, and by
      modeling long-term periodicities of actions. Empirically,
      modeling time-varying propensities of actions yields 53% and
      40% accuracy on the two activity logging datasets. Modeling
      short-term dependencies between actions improves this to 59%
      and 49%, respectively. Also capturing long-term periodicities
      of actions further improves this to 61% and 51%,
      respectively. Thus, capturing these three properties is
      essential to predicting periodic and interdependent human
      action sequences.</p>

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>]) have formulated the problem as a
      discrete-time sequence prediction task and used Markov
      models. However, Markov models assume unit time steps and are
      further unable to capture long-range dependencies since the
      overall state-space will grow exponentially in the number of
      time steps considered&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>]. Other works have used LSTM
      models&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>],
      which also assume discrete time steps and are limited in
      their interpretability.</p>
      <p>In contrast, we also model and predict <em>when</em> the
      next action will occur, which is critical to surface
      recommendations and reminders at the right time. In addition,
      instead of specific web queries or item consumption, we
      consider a broader set of higher-level actions such as
      watching a movie, going for a run, or going to sleep.</p>
      <p><strong>Patterns of repeat consumption.</strong>Another
      line of work has studied repeated actions, in particular in
      the space of item consumption, including video binge
      watching&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>]. More recent work has focused on
      modeling these behaviors and proposed models based on
      patterns of boredom&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>].</p>
      <p>Importantly, patterns of human actions in the real world,
      which are modeled in this work, are fundamentally different
      from patterns of item consumption due to their higher-level
      notion (<em>e.g.</em>, watching a movie, not which specific
      one). For example, patterns of boredom&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>] suggest that the
      probability of repeating an action within a short amount of
      time is unlikely. In contrast, we empirically observe the
      opposite in some cases, such as users commuting one way being
      extremely likely to commute back in the near future. More
      generally, real-world actions are characterized by more
      complex dynamics including time-varying behavior,
      interdependence, and periodicity of actions.</p>
      <p><strong>Temporal point processes.</strong>Recent work has
      considered temporal point processes&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

      future user actions <em>and</em> their timing.</p>
      <p>We extend this line of work by explicitly modeling
      time-varying action propensities as well as developing a
      novel combination of Exponential and Weibull kernels to model
      short-term and long-term periodic dependencies between
      actions. Further, we demonstrate that these aspects are
      critical when predicting real-world user actions and their
      timing across two real-world activity logging datasets.</p>

      </header>
      <p>The task considered in this work is, given a user and her
      history, a timestamped sequence of her actions in the past,
      to predict the user's future actions and the timing of these
      actions.</p>
      <p>Formally, let <em>U</em> be a set of users. Each user
      <em>u</em> ∈ <em>U</em> has an action sequence, which we
      represent as a user history <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$H_{u} = \lbrace
      (a_{un},t_{un})\rbrace _{n=1}^{N_{u}}$</span></span> with a
      total of <em>N<sub>u</sub></em> events. Each element in
      <em>H<sub>u</sub></em> is an event consisting of an action
      and timestamp representing that user <em>u</em> takes action
      <em>a<sub>un</sub></em> ∈ <em>A</em> at time <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$t_{un} \in \mathbb
      {R}^+$</span></span> (0 ≤ <em>t<sub>un</sub></em> ≤
      <em>T</em>). <em>T</em> denotes the end of our observation
      period. For example, <em>a<sub>un</sub></em> could correspond
      to watching a movie or going for a run (but not which
      specific movie or run). We assume that events are sorted by
      their timestamps, <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$t_{un} \le t_{un^{\prime }}$</span></span> for
      <em>n</em> &lt; <em>n</em>′. We denote the set of events
      before time <em>t</em> in user history <em>H<sub>u</sub></em>
      as <em>H<sub>ut</sub></em> = {(<em>a</em>′,
      <em>t</em>′)|(<em>a</em>′, <em>t</em>′) ∈
      <em>H<sub>u</sub></em> and <em>t</em>′ &lt; <em>t</em>}.</p>
      <p>The task of predicting future user actions and when they
      will occur can now be formalized as follows. Given user
      history <em>H<sub>ut</sub></em> up until time <em>t</em>,
      predict the next <em>K</em> actions the user will take and
      their timing <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$\lbrace (a_k,t^{\prime }_k)\rbrace
      _{k=1}^K$</span></span> , where <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$t^{\prime }_k {\gt}
      t$</span></span> (<em>i.e.</em>, these are the actions with
      the smallest <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$t^{\prime }_k {\gt} t$</span></span> among all
      possible future user actions).</p>
      <p>Here, we propose a novel multivariate temporal point
      process model for this prediction task and focus on the case
      of <em>K</em> = 1.</p>

        <p>To illustrate critical properties of real-world actions
        we use a dataset of logged activities from a mobile

        previous work on activity logging&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

        allows users to track their various daily activities
        including drink, sleep, heart rate, running, weight, food,
        walking, biking, workout, and stretching actions. For
        example, the drink action is logged to keep track of the
        user's daily fluid intake and the workout action is used to
        log various indoor exercises such as weightlifting or
        indoor-cycling. This dataset includes over four thousand
        active users taking 1.2 million actions over the course of
        seven months (all users logged at least two unique actions
        per day on average). Due to the popularity of the app, this
        set of users is very diverse in terms of age, gender,
        health status, country of origin, and other

          </div>
        </figure><strong>Time-varying propensities of
        actions.</strong>Human real-world actions vary over time,
        for example based on time of day (<em>e.g.</em>, having
        meals in the morning, at mid-day, and in the evening) and
        day of week (<em>e.g.</em>, working out on the weekends).
        This dynamic is evident in real-world data of human
        activities as illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig"
        href="#fig1">1</a>. The figure shows the distribution of
        the timing of three types of actions throughout the day:
        wake-up (from sleep), food, and bike. First, we observe
        that all three distributions are clearly non-uniform over
        time. For example, wake-up actions are clustered at around
        07:00 hours (7 am). Second, we observe significant
        differences in the propensities to take different actions.
        While for sleep we observe a uni-modal distribution
        concentrated in the early morning, we observe a bi-modal
        distribution for biking. The two modes in the morning and
        evening likely correspond to commute activity where users
        log their rides to and from work. We also observe two clear
        modes for food during lunch and dinner times. However,
        breakfast times seem to vary more widely across users and
        are more dispersed. Summarizing, we observe non-uniform,
        temporal distributions with varying number of modes that
        vary across actions.

            that the likelihood of drink, weight, and heart-rate
            actions declines quickly after both run and wake-up
            actions. However, note that fraction of heart-rate
            actions decreases much quicker after wake-up than after
            runs.</span>
          </div>
        </figure><strong>Short-term dependencies between
        actions.</strong>Certain actions make it more likely that
        some other actions will follow shortly. For example, people
        might drink water right after exercising or stretch right
        before running. In order to examine the short-term
        correlations between actions, we extract interarrival times
        between pairs of actions (<em>i.e.</em>, the elapsed time
        between the two actions) from a set of action histories.
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> shows the
        distribution of interarrival times for several pairs of
        user actions after run actions (left) and sleep actions
        (right). We make two important observations. First, the
        monotonically decreasing curves show that the likelihood of
        other actions is largest right after an action has
        happened. After this, the likelihood declines very quickly
        in a monotonic manner (note the log scale of the Y-axis).
        This points to a self-excitation dynamic of logged human
        actions. For example, users are very likely to follow up on
        runs or waking up from sleep with drinking water or
        measuring their heart rate or weight. Specifically, about
        50% of the weight measurements which happen within 6 hours
        of waking up occur right within the first 30 minutes.
        Second, we find that the action dependency patterns vary
        across actions. For example, drinking is more common after
        runs than after waking up and heart rate measurements fall
        off more sharply right after waking up than after runs. In
        summary, human actions in the real world often trigger
        other actions within a short period but these patterns are
        different across actions. We can leverage these
        correlations among actions when predicting future events.

        exhibit periodic behaviors such as waking up at about the

        8 hours of work. Therefore, logged real-world actions
        likely follow periodic recurrence patterns in which the

        "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] (<em>e.g.</em>, measuring one's
        weight before breakfast). We illustrate these dynamics
        using interarrival times between bike events in real-world
        data. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> shows
        the distribution of interarrival times up to a maximum of
        30h, where the two curves represent observed dynamics when
        the first of the two bike actions occurred during specific
        times of day (6-12h in solid black and 12-18h in dashed red
        line; note that these correspond to the timing and not the
        duration of the bike action).
        <p></p>
        <p>We make two important observations. Previously, we had
        observed that short-term dependencies between actions
        exhibit monotonic decay. Here, we observe that this strong
        monotonic decay only holds within the first few hours and
        that we observe multiple additional peaks for both
        distributions after this initial phase. Second, we observe
        that these peaks occur at different times based on when the
        first action occurred. In the case of the distribution for
        bike actions following a 6-12h bike ride, we observe peaks
        at around 9 and 24 hours (interarrival times), and peaks at
        around 14 and 24 hours for bike actions following a 12-18h
        bike ride. This behavior is not unexpected. When biking in
        the morning (6-12h), the next bike ride will likely be a
        commute back around 9h later. However, if the bike ride
        happens in the evening (12-18h), the next bike ride is
        likely not during the middle of the night, but after 14
        hours or at around 8:00h in the morning. In addition, both
        curves exhibit a daily, 24h, periodicity. Modeling these
        periodicities allows us to capture user-specific timing of,
        for example, a late evening commute signaling a later start
        the next morning. In conclusion, two important dynamics
        could help predicting future real-world actions: actions
        display periodic recurrence and the time of recurrence can
        depend on the time of day.</p>

        processes can be characterized via the conditional

        <p><strong>Short-term dependencies between actions:

        <p><strong>Long-term periodic effects:

      <p>This section evaluates the predictive performance of our
      proposed model on two real-world datasets on predicting the
      next user action and when it will occur. We compare against
      eleven different baselines on each dataset. However, since
      many baseline models are unable to make joint predictions of
      action and timing, we evaluate these two tasks separately.
      Importantly, this process allows us to identify the
      individual sources of error that would impact joint
      predictions. Our implementation is available at <a class=

        <p><strong>Argus dataset.</strong>We use the activity
        logging data from the Argus mobile app described in
        Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-8">4.1</a>. Users in
        this dataset can log 10 different actions (drink, sleep,
        heart rate, running, weight, food, walking, biking,
        workout, and stretching) and our goal is to predict which
        of these 10 actions a user will take next (and when). Our
        analyses include users who logged at least two unique
        actions per day on average (other users might only use the
        app to for example track their sleep making predictions of
        actions and their timing almost trivial; we find that our
        results are robust to different choices of this threshold).
        We consider 7 months of data from the app in a rolling
        window evaluation, where we use one month for training and
        the next for testing (<em>i.e.</em>, making out-of-sample
        predictions; without retraining). As shown in
        Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a>, the dataset
        includes 2.1 million actions by over 4 thousand users
        within the 7 month observation period.</p>
        <p><strong>Under Armour dataset (UA).</strong>We also use
        activity logging data from Under Armour mobile apps
        (<em>i.e.</em>, MapMyFitness and MyFitnessPal; focusing on
        users that are active in both apps). Users in this dataset
        can log 8 different types of actions (running, walking,
        biking, workout, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks). Our
        analyses include users who logged at least four unique
        actions per day on average, leading to a similar number of
        unique actions per user on average compared to the Argus
        dataset (again, our results are robust to different choices
        of this threshold). We consider 10 months of data from the
        app and again perform a rolling window evaluation where we
        train on one month and test on the next. In total, this
        dataset comprises 15 thousand users taking 9.8 million
        actions (Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a>).</p>

        </header>
        <p>Note that our model has few core model parameters. In
        the context of the datasets described above, we have about
        500 core model parameters (β, μ, σ, Θ, Ω, Φ, Γ, K) and
        about 25 thousand personalization parameters (α). This
        small, non-redundant set of parameters allows us to train
        the model efficiently and robustly, and explain model
        predictions through inspection and visualization of model
        parameters (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
        "#sec-20">6.6</a>), while performing competitively
        (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-18">6.4</a>).
        However, during training time (but not test time) we also
        have latent variables (p, q, r) that allow us to learn the
        core model parameters. These latent variables represent
        which actions trigger which other actions, leading to
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathcal
        {O}(|U| (max_{u \in U} N_u)^2)$</span></span> variables in
        the worst case. On both datasets, inference of both core
        model and latent parameters involves solving an
        optimization problem with over 200 million total variables
        (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-13">5.3</a>; we
        randomly initialize all parameters). Using our EM-based
        inference procedure we can robustly infer these parameters
        in less than ten hours using a single-threaded C++
        implementation on a single machine. We find that one month
        of training data is enough to reliably train our model.</p>

        <p>In Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-12">5.2</a> we
        developed a model consisting of three parts: time variation
        modeled using a mixture of Gaussians (Time
        <sub><em>u</em></sub> (<em>t</em>, <em>a</em>)), short-term
        dependencies between actions modeled by a Hawkes process
        with Exponential decay function (ShortTerm
        <sub><em>u</em></sub> (<em>t</em>, <em>a</em>)), and
        long-term periodicity modeled through Weibull distributions
        (LongTerm <sub><em>u</em></sub> (<em>t</em>, <em>a</em>)).
        Here, we test empirically whether these parametric
        assumptions hold true in real data. Using the Argus
        dataset, we inferred appropriate parameters for these
        distributions.</p>
        <p>We demonstrate qualitatively in Figure&nbsp;<a class=
        "fig" href="#fig5">5</a> that the chosen distributions fit
        real-world dynamics well. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig5">5</a> (a) shows the time-varying propensity with
        superimposed mixture of Gaussian fit and (b) shows that,
        collectively, Exponential and Weibull distribution closely
        approximate the influence of previous actions (example data
        is for bike action as seen in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig"
        href="#fig1">1</a>).</p>
        <p>We have further quantitatively evaluated our parametric
        assumptions and compared our choices to alternative
        distributions (<em>e.g.</em>, Rayleigh and Power-law)
        through goodness-of-fit tests which have shown that the
        suggested distributions best fit real-world data.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>First, we evaluate our proposed model in terms of its
        accuracy in predicting actions at a given time. The task is
        to predict the <em>n</em> + 1-st action <em>a</em>
        <sub><em>un</em> + 1</sub> of user <em>u</em>, given time
        <em>t</em> <sub><em>un</em> + 1</sub> and past user history
        H <sub><em>u</em></sub> = {(<em>a</em>
        <sub><em>u</em>1</sub>, <em>t</em> <sub><em>u</em>1</sub>),
        ⋅⋅⋅, (<em>a<sub>un</sub></em> , <em>t<sub>un</sub></em> )}.
        For each two month period in both datasets, we use the
        first month for training and the second month for testing
        and perform a rolling window evaluation, where we predict
        each test set event given all events that happened before
        it (without retraining). We use accuracy, the percentage of
        correct predictions, over all test events as our evaluation
        measure (the most common measure to evaluate recommender
        systems&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>]). We also report macro-averaged
        recall&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0039">39</a>] corresponding to averaging
        prediction accuracy equally weighted across all action
        types. This measure highlights differences in predictive
        performance on rare actions that do not affect the standard
        accuracy measure very much. We find very similar results
        using other classification metrics (<em>e.g.</em>, ROC AUC,
        F1). The number of mixtures for the time-varying action
        propensity (Equation&nbsp;<a class="eqn" href="#eq3">3</a>)
        is set via cross-validation. We compare our proposed model
        against the following seven baseline models, which have
        proven competitive across a wide variety of prediction
        tasks and recommender systems:</p>

        We observe that the eleven baselines achieve accuracies of
        36-57% on the Argus dataset and 20-46% on the Under Armour
        dataset with the RNN baseline performing best in both
        datasets. The limited predictive performance of these
        competitive baselines shows that this prediction task is
        non-trivial. TIPAS outperforms all baselines on both Argus
        (60.9%; 6-69% rel. improvement) and Under Armour datasets
        (50.9%; 11-156% rel. improvement). The small standard error
        across multiple dataset splits in the rolling window
        evaluation (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>)
        demonstrates that our training procedure is robust and
        consistently shows good performance. We note that TIPAS
        performs particularly well on rare actions leading to
        9-256% relative improvement in macro-averaged recall over
        baseline models (Online Appendix&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Results: Comparison of individual model
        components.</strong>Note that TIPAS has three components
        (Equation&nbsp;<a class="eqn" href="#eq2">2</a>):
        time-varying action propensities (Time), short-term
        interdependencies between actions (Short), and long-term
        periodic effects (Long). Here, we evaluate the performance
        of each of these components in an ablation study by
        comparing Time, Time+Short, and the full TIPAS model
        combining Time+Short+Long (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig7">7</a>; all models include user personalized
        preferences <em>α<sub>ua</sub></em> ). We find that
        modeling time-varying action propensities achieves an
        accuracy of 53% and 40% on the two datasets, respectively.
        Further, modeling short-term dependencies between actions
        improves this to 59% and 49%, and capturing long-term
        periodicities of actions further improves this to 61% and
        51%, respectively. This demonstrates that capturing all
        three properties is essential to predicting actions in both
        datasets of human real-world action sequences. Further, we
        observe a bigger difference between the full
        Time+Short+Long model and the Time+Short model in terms of
        macro-averaged recall (7% and 5% relative MAR improvements
        compared to 3% and 4% in terms of accuracy on the Argus and
        Under Armour datasets, respectively). This indicates that
        modeling long-term periodicities is especially important
        for more rare actions such as walking and biking. In
        addition, we find that modeling long-term periodic effects
        discretized by time of day (0-6h, 6-12h, 12-18h, 18-24h)
        performs significantly better than not discretizing by time
        of day on both datasets. For example, actions such as
        biking and walking are periodic but vary based on time of
        day (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>). Our
        full model captures these time-of-day dependent long-term
        effects and relatively improves macro-averaged recall of
        predicting biking and walking actions by 491-556% over Time
        model and 2-4% over Time+Short model.</p>

            the Time of the Next Action</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>We now focus on the second aspect of modeling real-world
        actions: Predicting the time of the next action.
        Specifically, the task is the predict the <em>n</em> + 1-th
        timestamp <em>t</em> <sub><em>un</em> + 1</sub> in history
        <em>u</em>, given past events <em>H<sub>u</sub></em> =
        {(<em>a</em> <sub><em>u</em>1</sub>, <em>t</em>
        <sub><em>u</em>1</sub>), ..., (<em>a<sub>un</sub></em> ,
        <em>t<sub>un</sub></em> )} (we do not assume that the next
        action <em>a</em> <sub><em>un</em> + 1</sub> is given).
        Mean absolute error (MAE) is used as the evaluation metric.
        We use the same train/test paradigm as before (rolling
        window evaluation training one month and testing on the
        next). We restrict predictions to only events that will
        occur within the next 12 hours (<em>i.e.</em>, the time
        interval <em>t</em> <sub><em>un</em> + 1</sub> −
        <em>t<sub>un</sub></em> ≤ 12 hours) because these are the
        most important and actionable inferences (<em>e.g.</em>,
        predicting a sleep time many days from now may have large
        error, but it is also less relevant). In order to make time
        predictions based on TIPAS, we simulate the multivariate
        temporal point process using Ogata's modified thinning
        algorithm&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

        return the average time.</p>
        <p>We compare our model to the following five baseline

        </figure><strong>Results.</strong>Experimental results are
        shown in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig8">8</a>. We
        observe that all baselines perform similarly except the
        Time Copy model which performs significantly worse on both
        datasets. TIPAS significantly outperforms all baselines
        across both datasets by 22-35% in the Argus dataset and
        11-37% in the Under Armour dataset (relative improvement).
        Restricting predictions to events within the next 6 hours
        (instead of 12h as before), TIPAS outperforms the baselines
        even more significantly, improving upon them by 44-58% and
        37-41% on the two datasets. TIPAS is able to make better
        timing predictions because it is able to leverage three key
        components. First, it is aware that certain actions only
        happen during certain parts of the day. For example, it
        will predict longer delays in the middle of the night when
        actions are unlikely to occur. Second, the model can
        exploit dependencies between actions. For instance, it
        might predict a very short time after a run because many
        users will drink water or check their heart rate soon
        after. Third, TIPAS is able to exploit periodicities in the
        data. For example, it might predict an evening time commute
        because it observed a commute in the morning. In summary,
        modeling these three key aspects of human behavior allows
        us to make better predictions of actions and their timing.

        <p>TIPAS also allows for visualization of model parameters,
        which enables explanations of why certain predictions are
        made. This is especially important in the mobile health
        context, where model predictions may impact users’
        real-world health behaviors and therefore need to be
        explained and monitored.</p>
        <p>The inferred model parameters for
        Equation&nbsp;<a class="eqn" href="#eq5">5</a> are shown in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig9">9</a> a
        (specifically, <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$f(\Delta _{t^{\prime }t})=\gamma _{c_{t^{\prime }}a}
        \kappa _{c_{t^{\prime }}a} \Delta _{t^{\prime }t}^{\kappa
        _{c_{t^{\prime }}a}-1} \! \exp (- \gamma _{c_{t^{\prime
        }}a} \Delta _{t^{\prime }t}^{\kappa _{c_{t^{\prime
        }}a}})$</span></span> for <em>a</em> = food). These
        distributions correspond to when food events likely trigger
        other food events. The distributions show that meals are
        extremely periodic and that meals sharply determine the
        timing of the next meal, except for dinners after 18:00h,
        which do not precisely determine the timing of the next
        meal (18-24h, green). The periodicities vary between 5h
        after breakfast (6-12h) and 6h after lunch (12-18h). This
        is consistent with a typical schedule of meals at 7:00h,
        12:00h, and 18:00h. Importantly, this enables us to
        correctly predict that earlier lunches may lead to earlier
        dinners. Such predictions are critical for correctly timed
        interventions, for instance making sure that diet reminders
        do not come to late.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, TIPAS allows us to explain why an activity
        was predicted, based on the relative contributions of model
        components to the overall intensity function
        (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-12">5.2</a>). For
        example, after food actions users are likely to log other
        foods and drinks (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig9">9</a> b; showing <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$f(\Delta _{t^{\prime
        }t})=\omega _{a^{\prime }a}\exp (-\omega _{a^{\prime
        }a}\Delta _{t^{\prime }t})$</span></span> for <em>a</em>′ =
        food). This makes sense as typical meals include both food
        and drinks, and users may choose to log parts of each meal
        separately. Interestingly, users also often log their
        weight right after food, indicating that they might be
        conscious of how their meal might have impacted their
        weight. Lastly, we observe walking actions right after
        meals. Users may walk back from a restaurant, or they might
        attempt to walk off some of their meal's calories.</p>
        <p>While these results and examples are specific to mobile
        activity logging applications, the utility of our model may
        generalize other domains where behaviors are time-varying,
        interdependent, or periodic. Distributional choices for the
        individual may vary across domains but can easily be
        adapted in our model.</p>

      </header>
      <p>Accurately predicting the user's future actions is
      essential for personalization, user modeling, and timely
      interventions in mobile health applications. In this paper we
      demonstrated that real-world user behavior exhibits several
      complexities including a large number of potential actions,
      time-varying action propensities, dependencies between
      actions, and periodic behaviors. We proposed a novel
      statistical model based on multivariate temporal point
      processes that jointly models all these complexities of human
      behaviors. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model
      successfully captures these dynamics in two real-world
      datasets and that it significantly outperforms nine baselines
      on tasks of predicting the next user action and when this
      action will occur. Our model can serve as a foundation to
      predict more fine-gained attributes of real-world actions
      such as their duration, intensity, or exact location. Our
      results further have implications for modeling human
      behavior, app personalization, and targeting of health
      interventions.</p>
