Our vision is to analyze ordinances or local laws from websites with respect to the public reaction to them expressed on social media. This enables tangential surveys to assess opinions of residents, reflecting their satisfaction and views on urban policies. An important focus in our work is to determine to what extent such ordinances contribute to establishing the relevant urban region as a Smart City. Hence, we aim to categorize these ordinances based on their pertinent Smart City Characteristics (SCCs), of which a small snapshot with highlights is shown in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> (image source [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>]). Public opinion is gathered from Twitter, given its role as a micro-blogging site with over 330 million active users. The specific objective of the present research is to relate the ordinances to the respective tweets on Twitter that express the public reaction to them. <figure id="fig1">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191632/images/www18companion-371-fig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 1"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Smart City Characteristics &#x2013; Highlights</span>     </div>     </figure>    </p>    <p>We aim to connect ordinances to relevant tweets by drawing on their semantic relatedness. This is non-trivial, as ordinances and tweets both involve highly intricate and rather heterogeneous natural language, so simple keyword matching does not suffice. Traditional machine learning techniques [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>] and related advances are not found suitable for learning this sort of mapping, as they require vast amounts of training data. Since ours is pioneering work in ordinance mining, we do not have such prior training data.</p>    <p>To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-step approach for mapping that exploits the transitive nature of the connection between ordinances and tweets considering their relationship with SCCs. Specifically, the transitive property we invoke is that: <em>if the ordinance relates to a given SCC and any tweet relates to the same SCC, then the ordinance bears a connection to the tweet</em>. This approach is proposed because classical sources of SCC data, e.g. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>] are finite and are restricted to a limited set of identifying features that can be relied upon for mapping (see Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>). Thus, this transitive approach is more feasible than attempting to directly relate a seemingly infinite number of tweets to ordinances from various websites.</p>    <p>As a first step, we discover connections between SCCs and ordinances using classical SCC sources guided by common sense knowledge (CSK) from web-based repositories. In a second step, we consider the mapping of tweets to SCCs, again drawing on such CSK. This approach then enables us to directly relate ordinances and the tweets to the pertinent aspects of Smart Cities and also sets the stage for sentiment polarity classification [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>] and sentiment aspect analysis [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>] of pertinent tweets using suitable methods to assess public opinion.</p>    <p>This work aims for broader impact by contributing to the development towards Smart Cities. If we identify which SCCs are being addressed by the local laws or ordinances passed by urban agencies, we are able to provide feedback on how well their urban policies head towards Smart City development across various categories.</p>    <p>Moreover, this work relates to the theme of Social Sensing. Public reactions inferred from opinion mining (to be conducted after connecting ordinances to tweets using SCCs) can further enable involved urban councils and management agencies to judge public satisfaction. This can allow for assessing the appeal of Smart City ordinances from a public opinion standpoint, thus providing useful feedback to the agencies that may enable them to enhance their policies for Smart City development. To achieve this sort of analysis, we draw on artificial intelligence aspects of text mining, natural language processing, and common sense knowledge.</p>    <p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-6">2</a> describes pertinent related work. Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-7">3</a> explains our proposed mapping approach to connect ordinances and social media postings. Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-10">4</a> summarizes its evaluation through experiments and discussion. Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-14">5</a> gives the conclusions, including our findings and a description of ongoing research.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-6">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> Related Work</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>While there has been ample work on mining social media, most previous work differs substantially from the task we consider here.</p>    <p>There is a long history of research on link prediction in social networks [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>]. These methods, however, are geared towards creating links between homogeneous sorts of nodes, such as predicting friendship connections between pairs of social network users. The same applies to most of the research on the even longer standing problems of entity resolution [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] and alignment between resources [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. Only few approaches have targeted open-domain linking between arbitrary entities and concepts [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>]. However, these typically assume structured data as input, i.e. entities with a series of attributes. In our case, we are attempting to connect two forms of unstructured natural language text. On the one side, we have public ordinances expressed using highly formal language, replete with legal terminology. On the other side, we have social media posts consisting of text that is typically very informal in nature, including embedded hashtags, URLs, etc.</p>    <p>For social media text, one important line of inquiry has focused on unsupervised topic modeling and trend detection in social media [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>]. In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>], a fuzzy-based approach is used to preprocess and analyze hashtags in Twitter with the resulting fuzzy clusters being studied to investigate temporal trends on hashtag popularity. Such works however cannot easily be applied to the task of mapping tweets to a pre-existing set of ordinances, which we consider in our research. Neural vector-based representations of documents [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] also fail when the two items are as heterogeneous as in our case.</p>    <p>Some recent approaches on linking social media text have relied on supervised classification. While standard methods can be applied to predict links between heterogeneous items [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>], an important challenge is that large training sets are required to accurately cope with the short length (leading to data sparsity) and variability of tweets. To overcome this, the TweetSift system [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>] classifies tweets by topic while exploiting external entity knowledge and topic-enhanced word embeddings. The latter leads to topic-specific word embeddings such that the different senses of ambiguous words obtain different representations. However, this assumes that the knowledge base can provide highly pertinent signals about entities such as specific Twitter users. Our model in contrast exploits generic common sense knowledge and does not require a detailed labeled training set.</p>    <p>Furthermore, previous work has not considered the setting of ordinances (with tweets) and Smart City Characteristics, along with their challenging use of language. To the best of our knowledge, our work is therefore among the pioneering research in this area.</p>    <p>Much attention is being given to Smart Cities in recent years. Buses in Barcelona are designed to run on routes optimal for power consumption [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>]. Canal lights in Amsterdam automatically brighten and dim based on pedestrian usage [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>]. The work in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>] addresses the potential enhancement of automated vehicles by embedding them with common sense knowledge. Such initiatives contribute mainly to the <em>Smart Mobility</em> characteristic. There is also significant research on making use of technology in fighting crime, e.g. the monitoring system to identify and categorize crime-related events in text documents [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>] that was developed within the EU ePOOLICE project. Such research contributes to the <em>Smart Living</em> characteristic. The work in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>] targets the <em>Smart Environment</em> characteristic through cloud computing solutions for data centers (instead of on-premise servers). They analyze scenarios where cloud models provide greater energy efficiency, yet meeting productivity targets. Security, privacy, and availability issues are discussed for cloud usage in the greening of data centers. Free cooling for data centers as addressed in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>] by considering temperature, humidity and other parameters, also contributes to <em>Smart Environment</em>. The work in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>] has a tangential influence on <em>Smart Economy</em>. The authors propose a mathematical model to minimize trips in scheduled pickups and deliveries by cooperation. This is a cost-effective method useful in urban delivery systems to reduce operational expenses in a cooperative mode. Likewise, the research conducted in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>] has an indirect impact on the <em>Smart People</em> characteristic by addressing an aspect of 21st century education through collocation-based writing aids for second language learners of English, as they constitute a large part of the population in cities worldwide. The work of [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] while primarily impacting <em>Smart Environment</em> through its estimation of air quality by analyzing pollutant data, also has a secondary impact on <em>Smart Living</em> since it addresses issues from a health standpoint. Thus, several researchers are conducting studies to augment the characteristics of Smart Cities.</p>    <p>Our work in this paper seeks to make a notable impact here, by advocating for the deployment of common sense knowledge in the realm of Smart Cities. While works such as [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] motivate the need for common sense in the areas of <em>Smart Mobility</em> and <em>Economy</em>, respectively, the actual use of such knowledge in these paradigms remains at the stage of inception, e.g. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>]. As addressed in several works on common sense in machine intelligence (acquisition, representation, and application) surveyed in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>], the increased usage of CSK in many areas would promote much smarter machines. Our research in this paper aims to take a significant step along this avenue, with the overall goal of enhancing Smart Cities.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-7">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">3</span> Proposed Mapping Approach</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>The approach we propose for ordinance to tweet mapping through Smart City Characteristics (SCCs) is illustrated in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>.

These are <em>Smart Governance</em> (or <em>Government</em>), <em>Smart Economy</em>, <em>Smart Mobility</em>, <em>Smart Environment</em>, <em>Smart People</em>, and <em>Smart Living</em>, respectively.</p>     <p>Consider, for instance, the SCC <em>Smart Governance</em>. This encompasses the features listed next, some of which are also included among the highlights listed in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>.</p>     <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list1" label="&#x2022;">Transparency in government<br/></li>     <li id="list2" label="&#x2022;">Optimizing public service and administration<br/></li>     <li id="list3" label="&#x2022;">Direct involvement in public policies<br/></li>     <li id="list4" label="&#x2022;">Citizen participation<br/></li>     <li id="list5" label="&#x2022;">Positive and open communication channel with citizens<br/></li>     <li id="list6" label="&#x2022;">More informed decisions by feedback and engagement<br/></li>     </ul>     <figure id="fig3">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191632/images/www18companion-371-fig3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 3"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 3:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Relevant partial screenshot of WebChild</span>     </div>     </figure>     <figure id="fig4">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191632/images/www18companion-371-fig4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 4"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 4:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Part of Domain KBs with SCC (Subset of Smart Environment and Smart Mobility terms)</span>     </div>     </figure>     <p>Thus, if ordinances reference any of the above features, we infer that they likely relate to Smart Governance. However, these expressions are not particularly likely to be observed in the ordinances literally. If human users were to inspect these ordinances, they could draw relevant connections, which are often quite subtle, by relying on linguistic knowledge and common sense. To automate this process, we draw on common sense knowledge (CSK) web sources, specifically, the large WebChild repository [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>] with common sense concepts mined from vast amounts of data on the Web along with their <em>properties</em> and <em>relationships</em>. A partial screenshot of the WebChild browser appears in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>. This depicts a relevant concept <em>economy</em>, which pertains to a specific SCC.</p>     <p>Using WebChild as the main <em>CSK source</em> along with requisite information for knowledge base development [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>] and other common sense related sources such as the lexical database WordNet [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>], we build domain-specific knowledge bases on Smart City Characteristics (Domain KBs with SCC). These KBs are text-based and contain terms relevant to specific Smart City Characteristics derived from CSK repositories and SCC sources, using NLP and semantic matching.

We denote this as <em>C</em>(<em>T</em>, <em>x</em>). For example, if the ordinance text includes the term <em>smoke detector</em>, then CSK concepts help to semantically relate this with the SCC <em>Smart Environment</em> through the CSK properties of <em>smoke detector</em> that have features relevant to this SCC. This information is found in the domain KBs derived from the SCC and CSK sources.</p>     <p>The same ordinance can also have features that relate to other SCCs. It is possible that some terms in ordinances may overlap with multiple SCCs. In that case, they would be observed in the KBs of each of those SCCs. If such concept terms are discovered in the ordinances, their occurrences are counted towards multiple categories. For example, if a term such as <em>sustainability</em> occurs in an ordinance, then that ordinance would be counted under the characteristics of <em>Smart Mobility</em> as well as <em>Smart Environment</em> (see Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>). Thus, the counts for both of these SCCs would be updated in this particular example. Finally, all the aggregate SCC counts are examined and each ordinance is accordingly linked to the SCC with the maximum number of relevant features. CSK plays a crucial role in finding semantic relatedness for this mapping through concepts, properties, etc. Likewise, we map tweets to SCCs following a similar CSK-guided procedure. Using this, we finally aim to output the linkages between ordinances and tweets via mutual SCC connections. Thus, we emphasize that: <em>an ordinance broadly links to a particular tweet if they both map to the same SCC</em>.</p>     <p>This mapping approach used for linking them is summarized in Algorithm <a class="fig" href="#fig5">1</a> herewith.

Note that in our execution so far, only the closest matching SCC is offered as the ordinance mapping output, for simplicity. The same holds for the mapping of tweets to SCCs.</p>     <p>We evaluate of a subset of NYC council data that encompasses two recent ordinance sessions, namely, 2006 to 2009 and 2010 to 2013. Based on this evaluation, we obtain a summary plot of ordinance to SCC mappings given in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig7">6</a>. <figure id="fig7">      <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191632/images/www18companion-371-fig7.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 7"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 7:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Summary plot of ordinance SCC mapping</span>      </div>     </figure>     </p>     <p>The observations in this summary plot are useful to provide some feedback to urban management agencies on the extent to which their ordinances cater to various aspects of Smart Cities. For example, from the results, one can conclude that the Smart City Characteristic receiving the greatest attention is <em>Smart Living</em> in the first session and <em>Smart Governance</em> in the second session. In both of the sessions, the SCC supposedly receiving the least attention is <em>Smart People</em>. This may help the urban agencies to plan their future policies such that they make progress on policies pertaining also to those characteristics that have been received comparably little attention so far, in this case the <em>Smart People</em> characteristic. Details on various aspects of urban legislation impacts with respect to such analysis appear in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>] catering mainly to a domain-specific angle. This is an important motivation for our current research with ordinances, tweets and SCCs.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-12">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">4.2</span> Tweet to SCC Mapping</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>We extract thousands of tweets posted by the public on Twitter pertaining to NYC location-specific data. The Twitter Streaming API feature labeled <em>Filter Realtime Tweets</em> is used for conducting the extraction. The tweets are extracted to a text file and further processed using NLP techniques such as regular expressions. The relevant parts of the tweets such as their textual content and hyperlinks are retained. These are stored as cleaned tweets. The SCC mapping is then performed on the cleaned tweets using the concerned part of our approach as depicted in Algorithm <a class="fig" href="#fig5">1</a>. In Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig8">7</a>, we show only a small subset of cleaned tweets used among over 1,000 tweets extracted in our experiments. <figure id="fig8">      <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191632/images/www18companion-371-fig8.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 8"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 8:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Subset of tweets analyzed from NYC sites</span>      </div>     </figure>     <figure id="fig9">      <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191632/images/www18companion-371-fig9.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 9"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 9:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Partial snapshot of tweet to SCC mapping</span>      </div>     </figure>     </p>     <p>Based on these tweets, Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig9">8</a> depicts a partial snapshot of our program mapping these cleaned tweets to their most relevant SCC, with reference to the relevant part of the process in Algorithm <a class="fig" href="#fig5">1</a>. This is interpreted as follows. Among tweets processed herewith, the overall mapping indicates that 37 of them are on <em>Smart Economy</em>, 25 are on <em>Smart Environment</em>, 208 on <em>Smart Living</em>, etc. These are obtained by the processing shown in the figure, e.g., features of the <em>Smart Living</em> SCC include the terms: <em>home</em>, <em>benefits</em>, <em>tourist</em>, <em>building</em>, etc., while those of <em>Smart Environment</em> include: <em>energy</em>, <em>sustainable</em>, etc. (The terms are obtained from KBs built using CSK and SCC sources). It is observed in this figure that, overall, 352 tweets are mapped to SCCs (37+25+...+208). Hence, many tweets among approximately 1000 cleaned ones analyzed in these experiments are not mapped to any SCC. This could be due to the fact that not all tweets published by users pertain to SCCs. It could also be that some mappings are not precisely identified in the initial experiments conducted herewith.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-13">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">4.3</span> Assessment and Discussion</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>In order to facilitate judging the correctness of the mappings, we have developed very simple GUIs in our initial execution. We illustrate a relevant part of our <em>Tweet Mapping GUI</em> next. This accepts a tweet as the input and emits the closest matching SCC from the user as its output, or &#x201C;<em>No matches</em>&#x201D; if none gets matched. Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig10">9</a> shows an example of a tweet and its SCC identified as <em>Smart Environment</em>, while an example of a non-matching tweet is given in Figure 10. Both of these are partial GUI screenshots. <figure id="fig10">      <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191632/images/www18companion-371-fig10.jpg" class="img-responsive"       alt="Figure 10"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 10:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Example of SCC mapping identified</span>      </div>     </figure>     <figure id="fig11">      <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191632/images/www18companion-371-fig11.jpg" class="img-responsive"       alt="Figure 11"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 11:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Example of no matches for any SCC</span>      </div>     </figure>     </p>     <p>Considering several tweets entered and SCCs identified through this GUI, the correctness of these mappings is assessed by domain experts from Earth and Environmental Studies. A similar <em>Ordinance Mapping GUI</em> is provided for the ordinance to SCC mappings for enabling at-a-glance displays. These mappings are also assessed by the domain experts.</p>     <p>The actual calculation of accuracy is done using an <em>Accuracy</em> metric as follows. Considering the judgment provided by domain experts, if an ordinance or tweet is mapped to a given SCC by our proposed approach (or if it returns a <em>No Match</em>) and this is verified as correct by the expert, it is considered a <em>True Mapping (TM)</em>. If the expert labels this mapping as incorrect, it is a <em>False Mapping (FM)</em>. For example, if the approach indicates that the SCC is <em>Smart Governance</em>, but the expert states that it is <em>Smart Economy</em> or that it is a <em>No Match</em>, it would be a <em>False Mapping</em>. Also, if the approach indicates a <em>No Match</em>, but the expert states that it maps to a given SCC, it is still considered a <em>False Mapping</em>. In other words, the ground truth is defined by experts for the data analyzed herewith.</p>     <p>With this justification, we proceed to calculate <div class="table-responsive" id="Xeq1">      <div class="display-equation">       <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} {\textit{Accuracy}} = \frac{{\textit{TM}}}{{\textit{TM}}+{\textit{FM}}}, \end{equation} </span>       <br/>       <span class="equation-number">(1)</span>      </div>     </div> and this is used for measuring the effectiveness of our proposed mapping approach. This is analogous to the classical notion of true positives and false positives in data mining and machine learning techniques [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>]. (We do not consider true negatives and false negatives at this point in our research, since their appropriate definition needs further insights and discussions with domain experts. This is an aspect of future work). Based on the given definition of Accuracy herewith, we obtain the evaluation scores as listed in Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a>.</p>     <div class="table-responsive" id="tab2">     <div class="table-caption">      <span class="table-number">Table 2:</span>      <span class="table-title">Accuracy of Ordinance and Tweet Mapping</span>     </div>     <table class="table">      <thead>       <tr>        <th style="text-align:left;"/>        <th style="text-align:right;">Ordinances</th>        <th style="text-align:right;">Tweets</th>       </tr>      </thead>      <tbody>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Expert 1</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">84%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">72%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Expert 2</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">86%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">69%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Expert 3</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">81%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">70%</td>       </tr>      </tbody>     </table>     </div>     <p>Thus, the ordinance to SCC mapping, as verified by domain experts, is found to be accurate for around 85% of the ordinances. This is considered satisfactory on the whole, although there is scope for improvement. The main reasons for the difference are that some ordinances can actually map almost equally to multiple SCCs, and hence it is possible that our approach identifies one particular SCC as the top match, while an expert identifies another.</p>     <p>The accuracy of the tweet to SCC mapping is in the range of around 70%, which seems fairly reasonable for a start. However, it is much lower than that of the ordinance to SCC mapping. We present a few examples of tweets below that are classified incorrectly or return no match, thereby adversely affecting the performance of the tweet to SCC mapping in our approach.</p>     <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list7" label="&#x2022;">&#x201D;Wind 0.0 mph N.
