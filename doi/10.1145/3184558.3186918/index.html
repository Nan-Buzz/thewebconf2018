Accurately estimating of the user type affinity has various applications in ranking and recommendation systems. For frequent users, simply dividing the number of interactions with content (e.g., clicks) by the number of impressions (e.g., the number of times the content is presented to each user) would be a good estimate. However, such estimates are erroneous for users who have sparse interaction history, (e.g., new users).

An accurate estimation of the user&#x0027;s type affinity can benefit various tasks, such as personalized news feed ranking, item (music, movie, and story) recommendation etc.</p>    <p>For users that have sufficiently adequate interaction history (i.e., frequent users), a simple baseline is to divide the number of interactions with the content (e.g., clicks or purchases) by the number impressions (e.g., the number of times that item of the same type is presented to the user). While this simple baseline could be a good estimation for frequent users, such an estimation is often erroneous for users who infrequently interact with the items (e.g., new users). The problem persists for more sophisticated methods, such as item-based collaborative filtering methods&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] as they need interaction histories.</p>    <p>To address these limitations, feature-based approaches (similar to user-based collaborative filtering)&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] learn functions predicting the affinity score using non-click features (e.g., user demographics). As the prediction model does not use the historical interactions as the input, we can predict the affinity scores for users with infrequent or no interaction history (given sufficiently informative non-click features). For example, a model that learns from the purchasing histories of college students to recommend school supplies during the beginning of semesters is very effective for an electronic commerce platform. The model can correspondingly infer that new users who are colleges students may have the same needs, even if the platform has no interaction history for those users. However, one drawback of the feature-based approaches is that they do not take full advantage of the interaction history of frequent users. As a result, users sharing similar non-click features are considered to be similar, regardless of how they actually interact with different types of items.</p>    <p>Motivated by addressing the drawbacks of the above approaches, we propose a Gamma-Poisson model that aims to utilize the interaction history of frequent users, as well as to leverage a feature-based model for infrequent users. Our intuition is that we should rely more on interaction (e.g., clicks) histories when estimating affinity for frequent users, and more on the feature-based model for infrequent users. We conduct experiments on a large scale dataset for a click count prediction on publisher content and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-5">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> Gamma-Poison Model</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>Estimating user type affinity is to answer how likely a user <em>i</em> is going to interact (e.g., click) on an item of type <em>j</em>. We denote such tendency as the user type affinity score <em>&#x03B1;<sub>ij</sub>     </em>. We define <em>&#x03B1;<sub>ij</sub>     </em> as: <div class="table-responsive" id="eq1">     <div class="display-equation">      <span class="tex mytex">\begin{align} \alpha _{ij} = f(x_{ij}; w_j) \cdot \ g_{ij} \end{align} </span>      <br/>      <span class="equation-number">(1)</span>     </div>     </div> where <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$x_{ij} \in \mathbb {R}^d$</span>     </span> is a feature vector of dimension <em>d</em>. <em>f</em>(<em>x<sub>ij</sub>     </em>; <em>w<sub>j</sub>     </em>) is a feature-based prediction model that takes the feature vectors <em>x<sub>ij</sub>     </em> and output affinity scores. And <em>w<sub>j</sub>     </em> are learned parameters. Example features for a user could be demographic attributes (e.g., age, gender, and occupation), geo location, and interests. Characteristics for the type can also be used as non-interaction features, such as the popularity of the type, an age range of target etc. <em>g<sub>ij</sub>     </em> is a prior correction factor on the interaction (e.g., clicks) histories between user and type pair < <em>i</em>, <em>j</em> > .</p>    <p>Without loss of generality we assume that (1) one user interaction sequence (e.g., clicks of a user to each type) within a time period is a Bernoulli process, and (2) the interaction sequence (e.g., clicks of all users to each type) of all users is also a Bernoulli process. We also assume that the correction factor <em>g<sub>ij</sub>     </em> follows a Gamma distribution, i.e., <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$g_{ij} \sim Gamma(\alpha =1, \beta =\frac{1}{\gamma })$</span>     </span>. Based on these assumptions, we have the following of our Gamma-Poisson model: <div class="table-responsive" id="eq2">     <div class="display-equation">      <span class="tex mytex">\begin{align} g_{ij} = \frac{\gamma + C_{ij}}{ \gamma + E_{ij}} = \frac{\gamma + C_{ij}}{ \gamma + \sum _{e\in I_{ij}}f(x_e; w_j)}, \end{align} </span>      <br/>      <span class="equation-number">(2)</span>     </div>     </div> where <em>C<sub>ij</sub>     </em> is the number of interactions (e.g., clicks), and <em>E<sub>ij</sub>     </em> is the expected number of interactions. The interaction count <em>C<sub>ij</sub>     </em> follows a Poisson distribution <em>Poisson</em>(<em>E<sub>ij</sub>     </em>). We can use <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\sum _{e\in I_{ij}}f(x_e; w_j)$</span>     </span> to estimate the expected number of clicks, where <em>I<sub>ij</sub>     </em> is the set of all impressions of user and type pair < <em>i</em>, <em>j</em> > . Under the assumptions, we can prove that <em>f</em>(<em>x<sub>ij</sub>     </em>; <em>w<sub>j</sub>     </em>) takes the form of logistic regression, and <em>w<sub>j</sub>     </em> is a vector of weights on none-interaction features, i.e., <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$f(x_{ij}; w_j) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp (-x_{ij}^Tw_j)}$</span>     </span>. Also note that in equation (<a class="eqn" href="#eq2">2</a>) <em>&#x03B3;</em> is a hyper-parameter that sets the initial psudo-counts of the personal correction factor <em>g<sub>ij</sub>     </em>.</p>    <p>In the case of estimating <em>&#x03B1;<sub>ij</sub>     </em> for a new or infrequent user, both <em>C<sub>ij</sub>     </em> and <em>E<sub>ij</sub>     </em> are close to 0. Therefore, the affinity scores for such users largely depend on the model <em>f</em>, i.e. <em>&#x03B1;<sub>ij</sub>     </em> &#x2248; <em>f</em>(<em>x<sub>ij</sub>     </em>; <em>w<sub>j</sub>     </em>). In the case of frequent user, the type affinity scores would be compensated as <em>C<sub>ij</sub>     </em> > <em>E<sub>ij</sub>     </em> = > <em>g<sub>ij</sub>     </em> > 1 (penalized as <em>C<sub>ij</sub>     </em> < <em>E<sub>ij</sub>     </em> = > <em>g<sub>ij</sub>     </em> < 1) when the user interact more (less) frequently with the type than expected.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-6">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">3</span> Learning Parameters</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186918/images/www18companion-158-img1.svg" class="img-responsive" alt=""      longdesc=""/>    </p>    <p>Algorithm&#x00A0;1 outlines the iterative inference process for learning <em>w<sub>j</sub>     </em>. At first, the correction factors <em>g<sub>ij</sub>     </em> are initialized to 1. Step 3 and 4 learn the best <em>w<sub>j</sub>     </em> (coefficient) estimate under the fixed <em>g<sub>ij</sub>     </em>. In this learning process logistic loss is used, as <em>f</em> takes the form of logistic regression.

Given the new coefficient estimates, our algorithm updates the correction factors (as the expected number of clicks depends on the underlying feature-based model used) by equation (<a class="eqn" href="#eq2">2</a>). The process iterates until desired number of interactions or reached convergence. In this paper, the stopping criteria is defined as <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$||(w^t_j -w^{t-1}_j)||_2 {\lt} 1e^{-10}$</span>     </span>. In our experiment, the process takes less than 10 iterations to converge.</p>    <p>The labels used in the training data could be the ground truth affinity scores estimated for frequent users. Alternatively, we could use a click (interaction) prediction model as the feature-based affinity model <em>f</em>. In this case, the label is a binary variable denoting whether a user <em>i</em> interacts (e.g., clicks) with the presented content or not, (e.g., predicting whether a user will click on one story). The non-interaction features (<em>x<sub>ij</sub>     </em>) are extracted only from the user and the content themselves. In doing so, we do not need to explicitly define frequent and infrequent users.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-7">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">4</span> Experiment</h2>     </div>    </header>    <div class="table-responsive" id="tab1">     <div class="table-caption">     <span class="table-number">Table 1:</span>     <span class="table-title">Comparison on click count prediction task.</span>     </div>     <table class="table">     <tbody>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:center;"/>       <td style="text-align:center;">Poisson-Gamma (ours)</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">HTR (3-day)</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">HTR (1-week)</td>      </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:center;">RMSE</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">0.429</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">0.705</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">0.487</td>      </tr>     </tbody>     </table>    </div>    <div class="table-responsive" id="tab2">     <div class="table-caption">     <span class="table-number">Table 2:</span>     <span class="table-title">Comparison on click prediction task.</span>     </div>     <table class="table">     <tbody>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:center;"/>       <td style="text-align:center;">With affinity (ours)</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">No affinity</td>      </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:center;">NDCG@10</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">0.364</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">0.325</td>      </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:center;">Accuracy</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">0.87</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">0.86</td>      </tr>     </tbody>     </table>    </div>    <p>We have conducted experiment on Snapchat story data. Snapchat is a large social network that also features a Discover page, where stories from numerous publishers and channels are shown to users. The Discover page displays the cover images and the titles, once clicked the body of the content would be shown. We evaluate the effectiveness of the affinity scores obtained by our model in two tasks.</p>    <p>For click counts prediction, we aim at predicting how many times a user clicking on stories from a certain publisher using the affinity scores. We use <em>&#x03B1;<sub>ij</sub>     </em>|<em>I<sub>ij</sub>     </em>| as the prediction model (treating <em>&#x03B1;<sub>ij</sub>     </em> as probabilities), where |<em>I<sub>ij</sub>     </em>| is the number of impressions). We compare our estimated affinity scores estimated with historical tap ratio. The historical tap ratio (HTR) is defined as the number of clicks divided by the number of impressions within a period of time per publisher. We use 0.25% of the all users from 7/30/2017 to 08/05/2017 for training, and predict the click counts for the same users on 08/06/2017. We use Root-mean-square error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. For click prediction task, we aim at predicting whether a user will click on a story by using affinity score as an extra feature. We split the same data into 70% training and 30% testing and use xgboost as the prediction model. We use NDCG@10 and accuracy as the metrics.</p>    <p>Table&#x00A0;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> shows the result of the click count prediction task for different methods. We can clearly see that estimation by the proposed Gamma-Poisson model achieves the best result (RMSE of 0.429) compared with historical tap ratio (RMSE of 0.705 and 0.487 where using 3 days&#x2019; data and one week&#x0027;s data respectively). In addition, using the affinity score can further improve the click prediction task as shown in Table&#x00A0;<a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a>.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-8">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>In this paper, we propose a Gamma-Poisson model for accurately estimating the user type affinity scores.
