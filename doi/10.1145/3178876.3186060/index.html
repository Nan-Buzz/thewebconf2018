        <p><small>Digital advertisements are delivered in the form
        of static images, animations or videos, with the goal to
        promote a product, a service or an idea to desktop or
        mobile users. Thus, the advertiser pays a monetary cost to
        buy ad-space in a content provider's medium (e.g., website)
        to place their advertisement in the consumer's display.
        However, is it only the advertiser who pays for the ad
        delivery?</small></p>
        <p><small>Unlike traditional advertisements in mediums such
        as newspapers, TV or radio, in the digital world, the
        end-users are also paying a cost for the advertisement
        delivery. Whilst the cost on the advertiser's side is
        clearly monetary, on the end-user, it includes both
        quantifiable costs, such as network requests and
        transferred bytes, and qualitative costs such as privacy
        loss to the ad ecosystem.</small></p>
        <p><small>In this study, we aim to increase user awareness
        regarding the hidden costs of digital advertisement in
        mobile devices, and compare the user and advertiser views.
        Specifically, we built OpenDAMP, a transparency tool that
        passively analyzes users’ web traffic and estimates the
        costs in both sides. We use a year-long dataset of 1270
        real mobile users and by juxtaposing the costs of both
        sides, we identify a clear imbalance: the advertisers pay
        several times less to deliver ads, than the cost paid by
        the users to download them. In addition, the majority of
        users experience a significant privacy loss, through the
        personalized ad delivery mechanics.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The digital advertising business grew to <font style=
      "normal">$</font>194.6 billion in 2016&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0051">51</a>] of which <font style=
      "normal">$</font>108 billion were due to mobile advertising.
      In addition, it is digital advertising that fuels the
      internet as we know it. The vast majority of the content
      providers offer their websites or their sophisticated
      services free-of-charge (e.g. Google Docs, Facebook, Twitter,
      Gmail) in exchange for allowing third parties to access and
      display advertisements to their users.</p>
      <p>Online advertising progressively moves towards more
      personalized ad delivery through a programmatic ad-buying
      model. In this model, advertisers buy available ad-slots in
      the user's display in an automated fashion based on how well
      the advertised product matches the profile of the user. As a
      consequence, when a user visits a website, each of the
      available ad-slots is auctioned, and advertisers decide if
      they will bid and how much, based on the information
      (interests, income, gender etc.) they have about the current
      user.</p>
      <p>Following the above process, a careful reader identifies 3
      key role players: (i) the website provider who earns money
      from advertisers through the auctions, (ii) the advertisers
      that pay to promote, and eventually sell their products by
      delivering effective advertisements to the proper eyeballs,
      and (iii) the user that receives from the website the content
      of his interest, for free. Seemingly, everyone benefits from
      this model. <em>But are the users indeed receiving the
      content they want free of charge?</em></p>
      <p>Contrary to the traditional advertising (i.e. in
      newspapers, TV, radio), in the digital world, it is not only
      the advertiser that pays the cost of advertisement delivery,
      but the user as well! Indeed, it is the user's data plan that
      is being charged to download the additional ad-related
      KBytes. To make matters worse, there are several other bytes
      the user downloads regarding analytics and user tracking,
      totally unassociated with the actual content of the visited
      website. Of course, the cost is not only monetary, since the
      privacy loss of the above operation has proven
      significant&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0044">44</a>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we examine the hidden costs of mobile
      advertising for both the transmitter (advertiser), and the
      receiver (user) of the advertisments. In fact, we compare
      them for the same user profiles and investigate how fairly
      they are shared among the two sides. Our motivation is to
      enhance transparency regarding the overall costs of online
      advertising, and increase awareness of users regarding hidden
      costs they pay while using ad-supported online services.</p>
      <p>Past works in the area already attempted to reveal the
      hidden costs of advertising in the mobile ecosystem. For
      example, Gui et al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>] analyze free and paid version of
      apps to compare the advertising costs from the developers’
      side. They actively analyzed mobile apps to measure costs
      related to memory, power consumption and CPU usage. Similar
      to the study of Gao et al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>], they compared these costs with the
      users’ feedback from app reviews.</p>
      <p>This work is the first to our knowledge that measures the
      hidden cost of advertising when mobile users browse the web.
      Contrary to the above inspiring approaches, our more
      user-centric study attempts to examine these costs, not from
      a developer perspective but from the side of the end-user.
      Towards this goal, we design a methodology and we implement
      it in OpenDAMP: a tool to estimate the costs of advertising
      for both advertisers and users, by passively analyzing a
      dataset of user HTTP traffic. We collected a dataset
      consisting of mobile traffic from 1270 volunteering users
      that spans over an entire year, and use OpenDAMP to analyze
      it. Finally, we compare the costs of both sides to assess how
      fair they are shared across the two ends.</p>
      <p>In summary, this work makes the following
      contributions:</p>
      <ol class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="(1)">We design a methodology to
        measure the costs a user pays when receiving ad-related
        traffic. These costs may be either directly quantifiable

        loss of privacy. In addition, and building on previous
        approach&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        <li id="list2" label="(2)">We implement our methodology in
        OpenDAMP (open Digital Advertising Measurement Platform): a
        framework for passive weblog analysis oriented to digital
        advertising. OpenDAMP can analyze user HTTP traffic and
        detect ID sharing incidents among third parties (known as
        Cookie Synchronizations). In addition, by incorporating
        information from external resources and blacklists,
        OpenDAMP can classify the traffic based on the content the
        domains deliver, and extract metadata and charge prices
        from RTB ad-auctions.<br /></li>
        <li id="list3" label="(3)">To assess the effectiveness of
        our methodology, we collected a year-long dataset with
        mobile browsing traffic from 1270 volunteering users. Our
        analysis shows that the costs advertisers and users pay are
        largely unbalanced, In fact, users pay ∼ 3 times more
        through their data plan to download ads, than what the
        advertisers pay to deliver them to these users.
        Furthermore, the majority of users sustains a significant
        loss of privacy to receive these personalized
        advertisements.<br /></li>

      <p>In this study, we measure the hidden costs of advertising

      to redirect their mobile web traffic through our proxy for 12
      months. This way, we collected a year-long dataset of weblogs
      with a total of 250M HTTP requests (for security purposes we
      avoid breaking users’ SSL connections).</p>

            Quantitative &amp; Qualitative User Costs</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Besides the quantitative costs a user may pay to receive
        advertisements, such as the additional network usage, there
        is also an important, qualitative cost for the user: the
        loss of privacy. It is well known that companies comprising
        the online advertising ecosystem collect several types of
        user data: location, behavior, preferences, interests, etc.
        Such data are used by these companies to deliver more
        personalized advertisements to online users.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookie Synchronization</strong></p>
        <p>In order for all this abundance of user data to be
        useful for the companies, there must be a <em>matching</em>
        process of all the userIDs that the third parties have
        assigned to the same user. By the notion userIDs, we define
        a string able to uniquely identify a user in the online
        world. In the web, the userID is an ID set on the user's
        side typically in the form of a cookie (i.e. cookie ID).
        Cookies, however, are domain-specific, which means those
        created by one third-party entity cannot be read by anyone
        else (see same origin policy&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

        <p>To remedy this,&nbsp;<em>Cookie Synchronization</em>

        "#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>] was invented, with which third
        parties are able to match the different userIDs they have
        set for the same user. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig1">1</a> presents a simple example to understand in
        practice how Cookie Synchronization works. Let's assume (i)
        a web site (say <em>cnn.com</em>), which includes some code
        from <em>tracker.com</em> and (ii) another third party site
        called <em>advertiser.com</em>, which is not included in
        the web page of <em>cnn.com</em> and thus, <strong>does not
        (and cannot) know which users visit</strong>
        <em>cnn.com</em>. Now, assume a user who, while browsing
        the web, got a cookie (cookieID=<em>user123</em>) by
        <em>tracker.com</em>, and another
        (cookieID=<em>userABC</em>) by <em>advertiser.com</em>, and
        now visits <em>cnn.com</em>. As soon as the code of
        <em>tracker.com</em> is called, a GET request is issued by
        the browser to <em>tracker.com</em> (step 1). Then,
        <em>tracker.com</em> responds back with a redirect request
        (step 2), instructing the user's browser to issue another
        GET request to <em>advertiser.com</em>, this time using a
        specifically crafted URL (step 3):
        <em>advertiser.com?syncID=</em> <strong>user123</strong>
        <em>&amp;publisher=</em> <strong>cnn.com</strong> along
        with its cookie (cookieID=<em>userABC</em>).</p>
        <p>When <em>advertiser.com</em> receives the above request
        along with the cookie ID <em>userABC</em>, it finds out
        that <em>userABC</em> visited <em>cnn.com</em>. To make
        matters worse, <em>advertiser.com</em> also learns that the
        user whom <em>tracker.com</em> knows as <em>user123</em>
        and the user <em>userABC</em> is basically one and the same
        user. Therefore, CSync enabled <em>advertiser.com</em> to
        collaborate with <em>tracker.com</em> in order to (i) find
        out which users visit <em>cnn.com</em> and (ii) synchronize
        (join) two different identities (cookie IDs) of the same
        user on the web.</p>

          </div>
        </figure><strong>Privacy Implications:</strong> There are
        significant privacy implications for online users raised by
        the above syncing process. By using CSync, in practice,
        <em>advertiser.com</em> learns (i) that whom it knew as
        <em>userABC</em> is also <em>user123</em> and (ii) that
        this user has just visited site <em>cnn.com</em>. This
        enables <em>advertiser.com</em> to track a user to a much
        larger number of sites than was initially thought. Indeed,
        by collaborating with several trackers,
        <em>advertiser.com</em> is able to track users across a
        wide variety of web sites, even if those web sites do not
        have any collaboration with <em>advertiser.com</em>. Last
        but not least, after the CSync, <em>tracker.com</em> and
        <em>advertiser.com</em> can merge all data they have (and
        will have from now on) about this user. Nowadays, such
        cases of <em>server-to-server user data merges</em> take
        place at a massive scale&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>], with the different web entities
        conducting mutual agreements for data exchanges or
        purchases, to enrich the quality and quantity of their user
        data warehouses&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        "#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>].
        <p></p>
        <p>Thus, it is easy to anticipate, that the synchronized
        userIDs of Cookie Synchronization is of paramount
        importance for tracking entities in order to (a)
        re-identify users across the different websites they
        browse, but also (b) participate in user data auctions and
        marketplaces&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>], thus increasing the wealth and
        detail of the information they know about each user.
        Thereby, in this study, we use CSync as a proxy for privacy
        loss. In fact, assuming 1 CSync leaks 1 userID, we use
        performed CSyncs as a metric to quantify and compare users’
        privacy and anonymity loss in mobile web.</p>

        Advertising</strong>
        <p></p>
        <p>Besides user tracking, CSync, is also a core component
        of personalized advertising, which allows advertisers to
        re-identify (or retarget) users as they browse the web, and
        deliver them the proper ad. An example, as seen in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>, is the
        following. Let's assume a publisher, e.g., a shoes-selling
        e-shop <em>E</em>, which collaborates with the Re-targeting
        Platform <em>RP</em> to improve the efficiency of its
        marketing strategy. In addition, let's also assume an
        Ad-Exchange <em>A</em>, with which <em>RP</em> is also
        collaborating. <em>RP</em> needs to be aware of the users
        visiting <em>E</em> at any time, as well as their
        movements: what other pages they visit, when and for how
        long. Therefore, <em>RP</em> asks <em>E</em> to tag each
        page of its website by embedding a <em>Web
        Beacon</em>&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0040">40</a>] pointing to the <em>RP</em> in
        each one of them: a 1-by-1 pixel image (also known as Pixel
        Tag or Web Bug). This way, the user will send this web
        beacon every time she browses the page, allowing
        <em>RP</em> to know her moves and also set a cookie (e.g.
        <em>UID_RP123</em>) on her side. Now, let's assume a user
        <em>U</em> who adds a pair of shoes in her shopping cart in
        <em>E</em>, but never makes it to the checkout. <em>E</em>
        would clearly want to re-target <em>U</em> and serve an ad,
        directing <em>U</em> back to <em>E</em> to try and finish
        the sale.</p>
        <p>After a while, <em>U</em> surfs around the web, and
        lands on <em>awesomesite.com</em>, which is using
        <em>A</em> to monetize their ad inventory. Using a similar
        web beacon, <em>awesomesite.com</em> allows <em>A</em> to
        (i) learn about the visit of <em>U</em> and (ii) set a
        cookie <em>UID_A789</em>. Before <em>A</em> calls an
        auction for the available ad-slots of
        <em>awesomesite.com</em>, it trigger a Cookie
        Synchronization on <em>U</em>’s browser to share ID
        <em>UID_A789</em> with it's associated bidders (including
        <em>RP</em>). After this synchronization, <em>RP</em> can
        re-identify the user by matching the two aliases:
        <em>UID_A789</em> == <em>UID_RP123</em> and will bid
        accordingly to place a retargeting ad about the shoes of
        <em>E</em> that <em>U</em> intended to buy.</p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">2.2</span> The
            OpenDAMP framework</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>To analyze our traffic, we built <em>OpenDAMP</em> (open
        Digital Advertising Measurement Platform): a framework for
        weblog analysis oriented to digital advertising. OpenDAMP
        parses HTTP traffic and classifies it based on the content
        delivered by the domains. In addition, using metadata from
        public crowd-based resources<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id=
        "foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>, it can further categorize
        advertisers based on the products they provide (DMPs, ad
        platforms, DSPs, SSPs, etc.). Finally, leveraging the
        User-Agent field of the HTTP requests, OpenDAMP can
        identify the operating system of the device (iPhone,
        WindowsPhone, Android) based on the set hardware
        characteristics.</p>
        <p><strong>Traffic classification:</strong> As we noted
        above, using OpenDAMP, we are able to classify the traffic
        into 5 categories (i) <em>Advertising</em>,
        (ii)&nbsp;<em>Analytics</em>, (iii)&nbsp;<em>Social</em>,
        which includes social widgets and plugins and
        (iv)&nbsp;<em>3rd party Content</em>, which includes
        content originated from 3rd party providers (for example
        content from CDNs, embedded Instagram photos, Captchas,
        blog comment hosting services like Disqus and many more)
        and (v)&nbsp;<em>Other</em>, which includes the rest of the
        content that is the useful content the user is actually
        interested in. To do such classification, OpenDAMP uses a
        popular browser adblock extension's
        blacklist&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. This blacklist groups the
        different domains that belong to the same company (e.g.
        Google groups Doubleclick, AdMob and Adscape). It
        includes:</p>
        <p>1) Advertising: 770 companies resulting in 1395
        domains</p>
        <p>2) Analytics: 150 companies resulting in 239 domains</p>
        <p>3) Content: 111 companies resulting in 522 domains</p>
        <p>4) Social: 17 companies resulting in 58 domains</p>
        <p><strong>CSync detection:</strong> To detect the Cookie
        Synchronization processes of our dataset, in OpenDAMP,
        first of all we extract all cookies set on the users’
        browsers. Then, inspired by previous works&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>], we
        create a collection of heuristics aiming to extract all IDs
        shared among the entities which could possibly constitute a
        userID:</p>

      <p>In this section, we analyze the costs that users sustain
      to receive advertisements while browsing the web. In our

      HTTP requests received, Bytes transferred, files received,
      impressions received etc.</p>
      <p>All the above constitute quantifiable properties that we
      can measure to extract the final cost a user paid. However,
      while browsing the web, users also leak information that is
      useful for the advertising ecosystem and this is another cost
      of advertising. In this section, we also attempt to quantify
      this cost besides its qualitative properties.</p>

        <p><strong>How many HTTP requests are due to

        <p>First, we conduct a brief analysis to explore the
        contents of the collected dataset regarding the network
        traffic of the users. In Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=

        overall HTTP requests produced and the KBytes consumed per
        user through the year in our dataset (percentiles: 10th,
        25th, 50th, 75th, 90th). As we see, the median user has a
        relatively steady production of network traffic, thus
        consuming per month around 5891 KBytes, on average. In
        addition, we see an expected monthly behavior, where there
        is an increase of the produced web traffic during months
        that include long holidays (spring break, summer holidays
        etc.). A diurnal behavior can be also seen when measuring
        the time of day the traffic was produced. As shown in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a>, users
        produce web traffic in their mobile devices mostly from
        morning till early afternoon, and this repeats throughout
        the week.</p>
        <p>In Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>, we use
        OpenDAMP to classify the HTTP requests the average user
        fetches, based on the content served by their domain,
        across the whole year. Considering that 3rd party content
        is an essential (external) component of a website and its
        absence could break the provided functionality and degrade
        the experience of the user, we consider it as part of the
        actual content of the website. On the other hand, the
        Analytics category includes services which aim to monitor
        performance and behaviorally track the audience of a
        website. Thus, we see that the percentage of requests
        bringing to the user's browser the actual content they are
        interested in is steadily around 77% across the whole year,
        and the percentage of ad- and analytics- related percentage
        is as high as 19%, on average.</p>
        <p>Next, in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a>,
        we investigate what are the different resources a user
        retrieves for these two content categories through the
        year. In this plot, we present the distribution of the
        users (percentiles: 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th). For the
        median user, most of the advertising HTTP requests are
        animated and static images and scripts, besides the
        expected volume of HTML. Also, in analytics, the largest
        amount of requests are monitoring scripts.</p>
        <p><strong>How much of the downloaded volume is related to
        ads?</strong></p>
        <p>The cost for all of the above (additional) resources the
        user downloads is translated to consumed Bytes. This is the
        most important metric that not only monetarily affects the
        user's data plan, but affects also the device's battery by
        keeping its CPU and network card on, in order to marshal
        the received content. From Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig8">8</a>, it is evident that the volume of bytes for
        the downloaded static advertising images and scripts
        reaches around 700 KBytes and 850 KBytes, respectively; the
        90th percentile peaks at almost 10 MByte for each one. It
        is easy to observe in these two Figures
        (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a> and
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig8">8</a>) the large
        amount and size of the scripts that both Advertising and
        Analytics related domains instruct the user's browser to
        run. Note that these scripts, and the additional CPU cycles
        they require, are unrelated with the actual content the
        user is interested in, and therefore constitute a clear
        additional overhead for the user.</p>
        <p>If we have a deeper look in the HTTP requests and the
        volume of bytes they deliver, in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig"
        href="#fig9">9</a> we observe an increasing trend across
        the year, with the HTTP requests for ads requiring to
        transfer double the volume, on average (from 4KB to 8KB).
        Taken in conjunction with Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig6">6</a> which shows a steady portion of ad-related
        requests, delivering larger payloads in the same number of
        requests, although it may require more memory from the
        device, it gives the opportunity for the device to minimize
        the required latency to marshal/unmarshal each ad-related
        requests. However, we also suspect that advertisers take
        advantage of better mobile network speeds and device
        resources, as they become available through time.
        Consequently, they force each mobile device to download an
        ever-increasing amount of data displayed in the publishers’
        pages, at the users’ expense.</p>
        <p>Finally, we measure the portion of the total downloaded
        volume per user that is associated to Advertising and
        Analytics. In Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig10">10</a>, we see that a user steadily downloads an
        average 8.2% of bytes (extra to the actual content they
        browse) across the year, which belongs solely to
        Advertising (7.3%) and Analytics (0.8%) related content. We
        see a small increase in the ad-related volume with previous
        studies (5 years ago)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0052">52</a>] measuring the same volume at 5.6%.
        If we also add the Social-related traffic, the total
        percentage of additional content the user has to download
        reaches as high as 11%, on average.</p>
        <p>Using the results from&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>, <a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0041">41</a>, <a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0055">55</a>], we also provide an
        estimation of the power the ad-related traffic consumes on
        the user side. Given the results in Figure&nbsp;<a class=
        "fig" href="#fig10">10</a>, the network component of a
        mobile device alone consumes 7.98% more, due to the
        additional ad-related transmitted bytes, and 0.86% more,
        due to analytics-related bytes. This means that a mobile
        device, whose battery can sustain 10 hours of ad-free
        browsing, will last 9.2 hours due to the additional
        ad-related network volume received. In fact, and according
        to previous studies&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>], if we also consider the energy
        consumption of the display, this cost may surpass 15%.</p>
        <p><strong>Unlimited data plans</strong></p>
        <p>Passively measuring the cost on the users’ data plans,
        of course, comes with some limitations. First of all, there
        may be user devices connected to the Internet through WiFi.
        In addition, some ISPs recently offered <em>unlimited data
        plans</em>, providing a large volume of data (usually
        around 20 GB/month&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>]) to their clients. Despite the
        current issues of such products (i.e.,
        throttling&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0050">50</a>], high prices (70-90<font style=
        "normal">$</font>/month)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>], expensive Internet roaming), it
        is likely that in the future they will become cheap enough
        to become popular. Therefore, the respective monetary cost
        for users with unlimited data plans will become practically
        negligible. However, even in such cases, personalized
        advertisements do consume device resources (battery,
        network traffic, CPU, etc.), and still incur a high cost on
        user privacy and anonymity loss.</p>

        <p><strong>What is the user's exposure to Cookie
        Synchronization?</strong></p>
        <p>By using OpenDAMP, we detect CSyncs in our dataset and
        we see that for users with regular activity on the web
        (&gt; 10 HTTP requests per day), 97% of them were exposed
        to CSync at least once. Next, we separate and classify the
        pairs of entities that conduct CSync in our dataset through
        the year and in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig11">11</a> we show the portion of CSyncs performed by
        each type of pair. The majority (∼ 85%) of the CSync takes
        place within the different advertising entities, but there
        are also cases where advertising entities synchronize their
        userIDs with Social or Analytics related entities.</p>
        <p>Next, we investigate if the synchronizations the users
        are exposed to change over time. Hence, we extract CSyncs
        per user, normalized by the user's total number of
        requests. In Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig12">12</a>, we plot these synchronizations across the
        year. The median user receives 1 synchronization per 140
        HTTP requests, while the 90th percentile user is exposed to
        1 synchronization per 50 requests! Considering the
        different userIDs that tracking entities may assign to a
        user, in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig13">13</a>,
        we measure the number of unique userIDs that got synced per
        user. Evidently, a median user gets up to 63 different
        userIDs synced (at least once) through the year, and the
        75th percentile user gets up to 195 of their userIDs
        synced.</p>
        <p><strong>How much do tracking entities know about a
        user?</strong></p>
        <p>Next, we measure the pervasiveness of the tracking
        entities. Specifically, in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig14">14</a>, we measure the portion of the overall
        userIDs each (ad- and analytics- related) entity learned
        through CSync. Interestingly, ad and analytic entities
        follow similar distributions, and apparently, such entities
        tend to learn significant portions of userIDs. Therefore,
        although a median ad-related entity may learn around 0.03%
        of the overall userIDs, there is a portion of 5% of
        entities than learned more than 10%, and another 0.6% of
        entities that learned more than 25% of the overall userIDs
        in our dataset.</p>
        <p>As we described earlier, CSync is a mechanism for
        trackers to increase the identifiability of a user in the
        web, by joining their assigned userIDs. In
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig15">15</a>, we plot
        the number of entities that gained access to the user's
        IDs. As we see, the median user loses up to 20% of her
        anonymity to 22 tracking entities and up to 40% to 3
        tracking entities. Such an important leak enables a handful
        of entities to accurately re-identify the user on the web
        and construct a rich user profile by merging their
        collected data on the backend.</p>

        </div>
      </header>
      <p>It is of no doubt that digital advertising moves towards a
      more personalized ad-delivery approach, where advertisements
      are matched to the interests of the individuals following a
      programmatic ad-buying model. The most popular one is the
      model of programmatic auctions of the Real-Time Bidding
      (RTB)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>],
      which has a five-year CAGR of 24%&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. In RTB, ad-slots on the
      users’ displays are being sold in auctions where the higher
      bidder delivers its impression.</p>
      <p>More specifically, in RTB-based auctions, whenever a user
      visits a website with an available ad slot, an ad-request is
      sent to an Ad Exchange (ADX), which calls an auction and
      sends bid requests (along with user info) to ad-buyers
      (bidders). These bidders in RTB are usually Demand Side
      Platforms (DSPs), which are agencies that utilize
      sophisticated decision engines and aim to assist advertisers
      to decide at real time if they will bid at an auction and how
      much, based on the user info they receive and how close the
      advertised product is to the user's interests. The entire
      auction has a strict time constraint and usually takes 100 ms
      from the time that the user will visit the site till the
      winning impression is finally delivered.</p>

      <p>In this paper, we leverage mobile RTB to assess the cost
      that advertisers pay, in order to deliver personalized ads to
      users. For this, we search for a specific step of the RTB
      where the ADX notifies, through the user's browser, the
      higher bidder about its win. Typically, this notification URL
      is parametrized with a keyword agreed between the two
      companies (ADX and DSP), and carries the RTB price to be paid
      by the winning DSP. The price can be cleartext or encrypted,
      as shown in two examples in Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
      "#tab1">1</a>.</p>
      <p>Although the RTB protocol is well standardized by
      OpenRTB&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>] since 2010, in Figure&nbsp;<a class=
      "fig" href="#fig16">16</a> we observe a large heterogeneity
      of keywords used to define the charge price. In fact, each
      ADX may use its very own parameter, making the RTB process
      less transparent, and more difficult for an external observer
      to detect and study the RTB parameters and values used.</p>
      <p>We employ OpenDAMP and use pattern matching with publicly
      available lists of keywords from past studies&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>, <a class=

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>], and manage to extract a total of
      44997 cleartext and encrypted charge prices across all users
      in our dataset. These impressions come from over 770
      different advertisers and ad-networks. In addition, with
      OpenDAMP, we extracted the required features to estimate the
      value of the encrypted RTB prices. These features include
      user information that an ADX can provide to the bidders (user
      location, date and time of website visit, type of user
      device, user interests, etc.). Leveraging the technique
      in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0045">45</a>]
      and the extracted features, we computed an aggregated
      estimate for the advertiser cost per user, across the year,
      using both encrypted and cleartext prices.</p>
      <p>In Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig17">17</a>, we
      present the RTB market share of each bidder in our dataset.
      As we can see, from the market share segmentation there is
      only a handful of big players winning the larger portion of
      auctions. Specifically, no more than 5 companies have won
      67.7% of the overall RTB auctions. In addition, we see only
      14 of the total number of bidders in our sample, winning a
      portion of auctions greater or equal to 1%.</p>
      <p>In Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig18">18</a>, we
      show the CDF of the total cost paid by advertisers to deliver
      and display ads to the mobile users of our dataset. These
      prices (in blue) represent what we have detected and computed
      as the total cost across the year for each user in our
      dataset, and expressed in CPM. As we can see, some users are
      orders of magnitude more costly to reach than the average
      user: advertisers paid for the 75th percentile user up to 100
      CPM for the entire year, when they paid around 20 CPM for the
      median user.</p>
      <p>In the same figure, we also plot the distribution of the
      costs per impression per user (in red). We see that an
      impression for the median user costs 0.9 CPM, but it is
      interesting to see that there are three classes of users: the
      users who are quite cheap to reach and are below average
      (&lt; 1CPM), the average users that can be reached with
      around 1 CPM, and the more expensive users (&gt; 1CPM) that
      advertisers paid up to 9 CPM per impression.</p>
      <p>At this point, we must note that the above computed RTB
      charge prices regard only the value that a bidder paid for
      the specific ad-slot in a specific user's display.
      Commissions for possible intermediate agencies and platforms
      may appear, thus, increasing the actual cost that the
      advertised company may have paid.</p>

      <p>Earlier, we showed how much advertisers paid to deliver
      ads to users, through various RTB ad-campaigns and companies.
      In this section, we use this RTB cost as a proxy for the
      monetary cost of the entire advertising process (e.g. user
      tracking, analytics and finally ad retrieval). We compare it
      with an estimated cost paid by the users to download these
      corresponding ads in their device. In particular, we use an
      estimation of the cost per byte that users paid in their data
      plans for the total bytes downloaded for these ads. We also
      look at the privacy cost of users via the CSync metric, and
      how that also compares with the advertisers’ RTB cost.</p>

        <p>For this comparison, we use currently available
        prices&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>], for various data plans in the
        country the users were located, while the dataset was
        collected. Using prices for 20 different data plans from 6
        different ISPs and subsidiaries, we computed an average
        cost of Euros per Byte. Historically, the data plan prices
        have been dropping, thus, our estimation of the Byte cost
        can be considered a lower bound of the actual cost users
        paid during the data collection.</p>
        <p>In Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig19">19</a>, we
        plot the CDF of average cost per impression paid by the two
        parties considered: (i) the end-users for Bytes consumed by
        their phones for downloading advertising and analytics
        requests, and (ii) the advertisers for ads they delivered
        to these devices through the RTB mechanism. These average
        scores reflect the traffic across the year. We make the
        following observations. Surprisingly, the cost on
        advertising bytes for the majority (about 80%) of users is
        higher than the RTB cost paid by the advertisers.
        Specifically, we see that the median user paid an average
        cost of 0.0022 Euros per ad for advertising and analytics
        bytes, whereas the median advertiser paid 0.00071 Euros per
        ad. This means that for each delivered ad impression,
        <strong>users are charged 3 times more than
        advertisers</strong> who benefit from the ad delivery!</p>
        <p>Furthermore, we look at the average cost users pay for
        being delivered ads vs. the corresponding average cost
        advertisers paid for the exact same ads, for each user via
        a heatmap in Figure&nbsp;21(a). We observe that the counts
        are skewed towards the upper left triangle for many of the
        users. In total, 67.4% of users paid more in bytes than
        what the advertisers paid for the same ads to be delivered.
        This means that the majority of mobile users pay more in
        data plan cost to download each impression (or even in
        total through the year), than the corresponding cost that
        advertisers pay to send the given ads displayed.</p>

        <p>In section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-10">3.2</a>,
        we analyzed the cost of privacy for mobile users given the
        CSyncs performed by the advertising ecosystem. We measured
        how prevalent this practice is across users and through
        time. Here, we compare this privacy loss with the cost paid
        by advertisers in RTB ads delivered to users during the
        same time period.</p>
        <p>In Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig20">20</a> we
        show the CDF of the average CSyncs per impression (total
        CSyncs through the year in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig20">20</a> (line in blue)) that were performed through
        each user's device. We notice that the median user had
        about 3.4 synchronizations per impression, and 101 in total
        through the year. As explained earlier, this leads to loss
        of privacy to multiple third party companies.</p>
        <p>We compare this cost on user privacy to the cost paid by
        advertisers with a heatmap in Figure&nbsp;. We notice that
        the main mass of the distribution of users cluster between
        1 and 100 synchronizations per impression delivered (as
        also evident from Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig20">20</a> (line in red)) and cost for the advertisers
        between 0.0005 and 0.001 Euros, per impression delivered.
        Also, in totals across the year, users have been exposed to
        10-1000 synchronizations for all the ads they received, and
        these delivered ads cost between 0.005 and 0.05 Euros to

      <p>There are several studies aiming to measure different
      aspects and hidden costs of the advertising ecosystem. Gui et
      al. in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]
      measure the cost of mobile advertisements to the mobile
      application developer by performing an empirical analysis of
      21 apps. The authors consider several types of costs: (i) app
      performance, (ii) energy consumption, (iii) network usage,
      (iv) maintenance effort for ad-related code and (v) the user’
      feedback from app reviews. Their results show that apps with
      ads consume, on average: 48% more CPU time, 16% more energy,
      and 79% more network data. In addition, they found that the
      presence of ads in the apps affected the users’ overall
      opinion leading to reduced ratings for the app.</p>
      <p>Towards the same direction, Gao et al., propose
      IntelliAd&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>], a tool to automatically measure the
      ad costs based on the different ad integration schemes.
      Similar to the above work, IntelliAd aims to provide
      developers with suggestions on how to better integrate ads
      into apps based on the costs the users are concerned. To
      identify the opinion of the users, the authors utilize
      several user reviews from 104 popular apps of Google Play.
      The types of the ad costs the users were concerned more
      include: number of ads, memory/CPU overhead, traffic usage,
      and battery consumption.</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>]
      the authors quantify the network usage and system calls
      related to mobile ads, based on specific rules, aiming to
      quantify the difference between free and paid versions. In
      particular, they built a tool to profile apps at four
      different layers: (i) static, or app specification, (ii) user
      interaction, (iii) operating system, and (iv) network. They
      evaluate their approach by analyzing 27 free and paid Android
      apps. Their results show discrepancies between the app
      specification and app execution, as well as cases were free
      versions of apps were more costly than their paid
      counterparts due to their important increase in traffic.
      Finally, they observe that most network traffic is not
      encrypted and, even worse, apps communicate with many more
      sources than users might expect (as many as 13).</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0052">52</a>],
      they analyze the characteristics of mobile ads by collecting
      a large volume of traffic of a major European ISP with over 3
      million subscribers. Their results show that ad-related
      traffic is a significant portion of the overall traffic, and
      the associated market share is dominated by no more than 3
      big ad-networks. In addition, they evaluate the energy
      consumption of three popular ad networks using a custom-built
      app with an ad slot at the bottom of the screen.</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>],
      they analyze the browsing activity of a large sample of
      Internet users aiming to assess the impact of ad-blockers and
      regulatory policies which limit the use of third-party data
      for targeted advertising. Their results show that retailers
      attract only a small percentage (3%) of their customers
      through display ads. Although many publishers use ads as
      their main source of income, which makes them vulnerable to
      ad-blockers, browsing patterns suggest that ad revenue can
      generally be replaced by a small fraction of loyal visitors
      paying a modest subscription fee (e.g. <font style=
      "normal">$</font>2 per month).</p>
      <p>Apart from the academic studies, there is also an
      increased interest regarding the cost of the advertising
      ecosystem from the side of journalists and major news sites.
      For example, in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>] the editorial team conducted a small
      study measuring the estimated load time and data usage before
      and after blocking ad-related content on 50 popular news
      websites. Their results show that more than 50% of all data
      came from ads and other content.</p>
      <p>Contrary to the above studies, our more user-centric
      approach provides a methodology to measure the hidden costs
      of advertising through passive monitoring of the users’
      traffic. We compare the cost users sustain, with the cost the
      advertisers pay for the ad delivery. Finally, we not only
      measure the monetary and network costs of digital
      advertising, but also the implications in privacy and
      anonymity of the users on the Internet via Cookie
      Synchronization.</p>

      </header>
      <p><strong>Learnings:</strong> Unlike traditional
      advertising, in online mediums advertising imposes costs not
      only to the one who wants its message to be spread (the
      advertiser), but also to the one that receives it (the user).
      To make matters worse, the growth of personalized
      advertisement, where the advertisements are matched to the
      interests of the individuals, impose an additional cost for
      the users: the cost on their privacy and loss of
      anonymity.</p>
      <p>In this study, we compare the costs on digital advertising
      for the advertiser and the user, in an attempt to identify
      how equal, or even comparable these costs are. Surprisingly,
      our results show that these costs are unbalanced, with the
      majority of users sustaining a significant loss of privacy,
      when the monetary cost they pay is, on average, 3 times more
      than what the advertisers are charged to deliver the given
      ads. Our findings can be summarized as follows:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list11" label="•">Ad- and analytics- related
        traffic is 19% of the total requests, and 8.2% of data plan

        steadily increasing through the year, doubling from 4

        <li id="list13" label="•">Ad- and analytics- related
        traffic can potentially consume up to 9% of the phone's
        power, considering only the additional network

        <li id="list14" label="•">97% of regular mobile users are

        <li id="list19" label="•">The top 5 ad-companies dominate
        68% of RTB auctions.<br /></li>
        <li id="list20" label="•">Mobile users are exposed to

        0.00071 Euro per delivered ad, but the median user paid

      </ul>
      <p><strong>Impact of Advertising Cost</strong></p>
      <p>Our results showed that in aggregate, and monetarily, over
      2/3rds of users pay more through their data plan for
      downloading bytes related to ads and analytics, than the
      advertisers who sent the ads in the first place. In addition,
      given that: 1) the median user loses up to 20% of its
      anonymity to 22 tracking entities, 2) the top 5 ad-companies
      win the great majority of RTB auctions, and 3) these
      companies can sell the acquired data to 4th party companies
      in a non-transparent and backend fashion&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0046">46</a>], the loss of privacy
      experienced by an average user can be multiple times higher
      than that conservatively measured so far. Unfortunately, this
      pervasive user tracking effort to deliver more targeted
      impressions, fails to increase the effectiveness of the
      delivered ads. In fact, and according to&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>], the average person is
      served over 1700 ads per month, but only half of them are
      ever viewed, and click rates for display ad campaigns reach
      0.1% on average (i.e., one in a thousand impressions in a
      campaign is ever clicked). Furthermore, Budak et al.
      in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]
      show that retailers attract only 3% of their customers
      through digital ads. Therefore, even though someone could
      argue that the user receives value from free access to the
      websites supported by advertisers, the amount of ineffective
      ads delivered to user devices is currently extreme, and
      costly for the end-user.</p>
      <p>Considering all the above, the cost on the user's side
      with respect to 1) device resources spent for processing and
      displaying ads, 2) bytes downloaded and paid to the user's
      data plan, 3) loss of privacy experienced by the average
      user, all significantly outweigh both the efficiency of the
      received ads, and the cost paid by the ad ecosystem to
      deliver them to the user's device. Thus, it remains unclear
      whom the current advertising model benefits, apart from the
      ad-delivery and targeting companies.</p>
      <p><strong>Reducing or rebalancing the costs</strong></p>
      <p>Evidently, the annoyance, the inefficiency and the
      increased cost of advertisements have made users take
      measures to reduce the unbalanced costs they pay. The most
      popular of such actions is the use of mobile&nbsp;[<a class=

      ad-blockers. However, there are concerns&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>] that such all-out
      approaches are non-vital for the free Internet, as they
      significantly reduce the income of the ad-supported content
      providers, making them stop serving ad-blocking
      users&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=

      <p>Approaches able to strike a vital middle-ground and
      rebalance the costs between advertisers and users, include
      Personal Information Management Systems
      (PIMS)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=

      the user controls the privacy they expose to the online
      world, in return for a free service. A different approach is
      third-party ad-replacement systems&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] such as the Brave
      Browser&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>], where the user gets compensated for
      each ad they receive. In addition, there is the CAMEO
      middleware&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>], which aims to pre-fetch
      context-sensitive advertisement by predicting user context
      and pro-actively identifying relevant advertising content.
      This way, it can opportunistically use inexpensive wireless
      networks (e.g., WiFi) to predictively cache advertisement
      content on the mobile device.</p>
      <p>The contribution of our work is to shed light upon the
      actual costs of ad-supported web. This way, we enhance the
      awareness of users regarding costs that they can easily
      measure (e.g., on their data plan), or cannot measure (e.g.,
      privacy loss), in an attempt to help them choose between a
      seemingly free, ad-supported website and its paid ad-free
      counterpart&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0057">57</a>].</p>
      <p>Our future steps include active analysis of the user
      devices in order to measure additional hidden costs of
      advertising, that appear in power consumption, main memory,
      CPU. We will also study the impact advertising has on user
      experience by measuring the imposed latency due to the
      rendering time of digital ad impressions. In addition, active
      analysis on crafted user personas will allow us to determine
      the user data that get leaked together with the userIDs and
      if this is compliant with COPPA&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>] rules and DAA's
