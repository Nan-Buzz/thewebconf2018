        <p><small>In this demonstration, we present the Text-enabled Humanitarian Operations in Real-time (THOR) framework, which is being prototyped to provide visual and analytical <em>situational awareness</em> to humanitarian and disaster relief (HADR) planners. THOR is a collaborative effort between industrial and university research laboratories, designed with an intent to support both military and civilian HADR operations. At its core, THOR is powered by a domain-specific knowledge graph, which is derived from natural language outputs and is amenable to real-time analytics. THOR is designed to operate in low-resource linguistic environments, process heterogeneous data, including news and social media, reason about arbitrary disasters not knowable in advance, and provide advanced graphical interaction capabilities. We will demo the latest prototype of THOR using an interactive case study situation.</small></p>

      <p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (OCHA) reported<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> that in 2016, more than a hundred million people were affected by natural disasters alone, while over sixty million people were forcibly displaced by violence and conflict. Using interdisciplinary research from the data sciences to build a visualization and analytics platform for US civilian and military rescue personnel, as well as the intelligence community, is an important problem with the potential for widespread long-lasting social impact.</p>
      <p>The DARPA LORELEI program<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> was established with the explicit agenda of providing <em>situational awareness</em> for <em>emergent incidents</em>, under the assumption that the emergent incident occurs in a region of the world where the predominant language is computationally <em>low-resource</em> [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>]. An example is Uyghur, a Turkic language spoken by about 10-25 million people in Western China, for which few automated technology capabilities currently exist [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. The technologies resulting from LORELEI research will be capable of supporting situational awareness based on low-resource foreign language sources within an extremely short time frame (about 24 hours after a new language requirement emerges).</p>
      <p>The notion of situational awareness involves far more than <em>machine translation</em> of the low-resource language into English [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>]. In addition to <em>natural language processing</em> on the translated text (e.g. named entity recognition, sentiment analysis [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>]), solutions to problems such as <em>entity resolution</em> and <em>provenance reasoning</em> are required to support detailed analytics that are ultimately visualized on a graphical user interface (GUI) [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>].</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>We demonstrate the <em>text-enabled humanitarian operations</em> in <em>real-time</em> (THOR) framework that is designed to tackle a subset of the challenges proposed by the LORELEI program. Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> provides a contextualized illustration of THOR as part of a broader solution currently under development. The input to THOR is a <em>streaming</em> corpus of raw documents and a set of natural language processing (NLP) modules collectively denoted as the <em>Language Technology Development Environment</em> (LTDE) that includes state-of-the-art implementations for NLP services such as machine translation and named entity recognition [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>]. Note that LTDE is not a part of THOR. The LTDE outputs are used to structure <em>each</em> raw document in the stream into a <em>situation frame</em>, serialized as a semi-structured JSON document that contains a combination of unstructured and structured data, and metadata. These JSON documents are then visualized in an interactive GUI to support both search and analytics.</p>
      <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> presents the tile-based dashboard. Among the analytics that are rendered in the THOR GUI are <em>situation frames</em>, which classify each JSON document as expressing one or more needs in pre-set categories such as food or water. Along with facilities such as spatio-temporal rendering, these ‘situations’ are ultimately designed to help field analysts decide <em>where, when</em> and <em>how</em> to allocate resources to meet current situational needs.</p>
      <p>THOR is expected to support two different user-facing services. The first service, which will not be covered by this demo, is a direct product of the analyses tools and comprise machine generated reports such as mission plans and status reports. The second service is an advanced graphical user interface that is expected to support personnel to visually navigate diverse, spatio-temporally evolving crisis scenarios in low resource regions. An anticipated demonstration workflow is described in Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-6">2</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Innovations.</strong> Specific innovations in THOR are as follows. First, THOR is an integrative solution that unifies many different aspects of the crisis informatics problem in a single <em>knowledge graph</em>-centric framework. Second, THOR is meant to serve a variety of users in the real-world, ingests documents from multiple Web (and also non-Web) sources such as Twitter, news, text messages and Ushahidi, and is the result of a multi-organizational collaboration. Third, the THOR GUI is multi-faceted and customizable, including support for maps, charts, networks, and word clouds, along with providing both analytical and entity-centric dashboards. The GUI will be a central focus of the demonstration. Fourth, THOR expresses an innovative and visual way of rendering (potentially noisy) NLP outputs on a screen to users who do not necessarily know about the inner workings of such technology, but can still use the outputs to accomplish useful tasks (such as deciding when and where to allocate aid, in a foreign, low-resource environment).</p>
      <p><strong>Significance to the Web.</strong> <em>Crisis informatics</em> is an emerging field with a significant intersection with the Web, due to the proliferation of social media and real-time information channels [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. Although multiple computational approaches can be used for gaining better situational awareness in crisis situations, practitioners still tend to rely on methods and tools that are either <em>manual</em> or <em>non-adaptive</em> (e.g, keyword search, copy-pasting documents), or are too general for the domain-specific needs of crisis situations. THOR presents an important advance in this respect, and is also an example of using Web data and advancements for powering AI systems for social good.</p>

      <p>Earlier, we presented an illustration of the THOR GUI and dashboard in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>. In the actual demonstration, we will use the problem of <em>resource allocation</em> as our contextual backdrop. Namely, we will assume that we are in the still-evolving aftermath of a crisis situation, like an earthquake in the Haiti region. With text messages, and news, communications and intelligence fragments emerging from multiple sources in the aftermath of the earthquake, an aid provider seeks rapid situational awareness and is looking to answer questions such as <em>What are the focal (i.e. most affected) and hot-spot regions? What are the resources (e.g., food, water, shelter etc.) required in such regions, and how should they be allocated? Who are the primary political entities involved in the region?</em></p>
      <figure id="fig3">
        <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186965/images/www18companion-205-fig3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 3" longdesc="" />

        </div>
      </figure>
      <p></p>
      <p>We will also use a second dataset involving earthquakes in the Turkic region of China to illustrate the problems that can arise due to automatically translating a challenging, computationally under-studied (i.e. low-resource) language like Uyghyur (Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>). For such languages, not only is translation difficult, but other NLP processes like entity and relationship extraction and recognition are also difficult and prone to noise. For such situations, visualization is particularly important as the user is able to abstract away the effects of the noise and still make useful decisions.</p>
      <p>Finally, we will demonstrate how THOR seamlessly integrates with multiple LTDEs. This is facilitated by the API- and knowledge graph-centric architecture of THOR. Any LTDE that delivers its output using JSON and a simple pre-defined schema can be ingested and visualized by THOR. This implies that an LTDE does not need to be ‘frozen’ in order to be processed by THOR, but can continue to undergo improvements and organic development. Many of our partner collaborations in the LORELEI program expose their LTDE ‘pipelines’ as APIs on the Web, which means that the code does not have to be released or integrated either. Thus, the various components of THOR can fully interoperate in classified and proprietary environments, which can be an important requirement in sensitive regions of the world.</p>
      <p><strong>Infrastructure and Materials.</strong> The THOR system (including backend and frontend services) are currently running on a program-approved facility in the United States. The GUI itself can be rendered on a browser, and will only require us to use our computers, with an Internet connection. For backup purposes (in case the Internet connection is lost or there is high latency), we will also prepare a video walkthrough of THOR and how it is expected to be used, but the video will not be publicly released. Unfortunately, due to the sensitivity of the data that is currently being ingested in THOR, a publicly viewable screencast or video cannot be released at this time.</p>

      </header>
      <p>The design and architecture of THOR draws on many areas in Web-centric data management and Artificial Intelligence, including real-time processing of data streams [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>], online natural language processing [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>], especially named entity recognition [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>], machine learning problems such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>], knowledge graphs [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>], network analysis [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>], entity resolution and linking [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>], provenance reasoning [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>], route planning and graphical user interfaces [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. In the literature, there have been some examples of systems that act as ‘social sensors’ for the purpose of detecting disasters in real-time from social media streams, influential examples (for earthquake detection from social media) being [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] and [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>]. In principle, THOR resembles such systems; however, THOR includes innovations and capabilities not encompassed by any of those systems. For example, THOR has to take NLP outputs (especially machine translation), themselves noisy, as inputs, and ultimately outputs interactive user-driven elements. Also, THOR is designed to handle <em>emergent</em> disasters and incidents that may not have been seen before, unlike a particular disaster (e.g. earthquake). <em>Real-time scalability</em> is important in THOR.</p>
      <p>Visualization is an important part of any human-centric system that is attempting to make sense of a large amount of information. Several good crisis informatics platforms that provide visualizations include Ushahidi [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>], Twitris [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>], Twitcident [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>], AIDR [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>], CrisisTracker [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>], and several others [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>].</p>

      <p>The Text-enabled Humanitarian Operations in Real-time (THOR) framework is a multi-organization collaboration effort that is being implemented to provide humanitarian operators superior situation awareness for emergent incidents in low-resource environments. THOR involves many different components, and serves as the gateway between a large corpus of streaming documents, usually available over Web channels, natural language processing modules, and a broad category of users (military, civilian and intelligence personnel). THOR is under active development, and presents a variety of challenges that require interdisciplinary research at the frontiers of Web-centric crisis informatics. It also serves as an example of using Web and AI technology for social good.</p>
