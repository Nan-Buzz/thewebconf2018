        <p><small>There is an expectation that scientists will
        archive their experimental data online in public
        repositories to enable other investigators to verify their
        work and to re-explore their data in search of new
        discoveries. When left to their own devices, however,
        scientists do a poor job creating the metadata that
        describe their datasets. A lack of standardization makes it
        difficult for other investigators to find relevant datasets
        and to perform secondary analyses. The Center for Expanded
        Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR) was founded with the
        goal of enhancing the authoring of experimental metadata to
        make online datasets more useful to the scientific
        community. CEDAR technology includes Web-based methods for
        creating and managing libraries of templates for
        representing metadata. CEDAR's templates interoperate with
        a repository of scientific ontologies to standardize the
        way in which the templates may be filled out.
        Collaborations with several major research projects are
        allowing us to explore how CEDAR may ease access to
        scientific data sets stored in public
        repositories.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The past few years have seen an increasing demand for open
      science, where investigators make their data available for
      public access and reuse. There are obvious opportunities to
      make new discoveries by examining, integrating, and analyzing
      data provided by other scientists. Funding organizations and
      journal editors are increasingly insisting that investigators
      place their experimental data in public repositories for the
      benefit of the scientific community. The problem, however, is
      that submitting data to a public repository can be an onerous
      task that most investigators would like to avoid.</p>
      <p>Online datasets need to be supplemented by metadata—data
      about the data—that describe the subjects of the experiment,
      the conditions under which the data were collected, and the
      major steps that the investigators followed to perform their
      study. Good metadata are needed for other scientists to be
      able to search for relevant datasets, to make sense of the
      data, and to know how to reanalyze the data. The problem is
      that most datasets are annotated with very poor metadata
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. Metadata
      authors are burdened by cumbersome requirements, they receive
      too little guidance, and the result is that metadata are
      often riddled with typographical errors and they often fail
      to incorporate standard ontological terms when required.
      There is a clear need for methods to make it easier for
      scientists to author high-quality metadata and to archive
      their datasets in a manner that will assure that the data
      will be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>].</p>
      <p>We believe that the fundamental challenge of the
      open-science movement is effective annotation of datasets
      with metadata that are complete and comprehensive. CEDAR is
      committed to the development of tools that make it easy for
      scientists to create high-quality metadata [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>].</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">2</span> The Cedar
          Workbench</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>CEDAR is building an open-source suite of tools, known as
      the CEDAR Workbench, that form a pipeline for authoring
      experimental metadata [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. We are working in the area of
      biomedical science, where there is already a trend for
      different scientific communities to specify standardized
      templates that capture the minimal requirements for metadata
      related to different classes of experiments.</p>
      <p><strong>Metadata Template Repository:</strong>We have
      developed a standardized representation of metadata
      templates, together with Web services to store, search, and
      share these templates. Templates created using CEDAR
      technology are stored in our openly accessible repository.
      Researchers use the repository to search for appropriate
      templates to annotate their studies.Web-based interfaces and
      REST APIs enable access to the metadata templates, as well as
      to the corresponding metadata collected using those templates
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>].</p>
      <p><strong>Metadata Template Creator and Template
      Editor:</strong>Two highly interactiveWeb-based tools
      simplify the process of authoring metadata templates. The
      Template Creator allows users to create, search, and author
      metadata templates. Using interactive look-up services linked
      to the NCBO BioPortal ontology respository, template authors
      can find terms in ontologies to restrict the values of
      template fields. The Template Creator automatically produces
      a user interface specification as it builds a template. The
      Metadata Editor uses this specification to generate a
      forms-based acquisition interface for acquiring individual
      metadata components.</p>
      <p><strong>Intelligent Authoring:</strong> To ease the burden
      of authoring high quality metadata, a recommender framework
      learns associations between metadata elements and suggests to
      the user context-sensitive metadata values [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. The system can recommend
      possible values for metadata elements during the submission
      process as each field is selected and the user begins to
      type. The template editor also sorts possible selections in
      drop-down windows so that the terms that occur in the
      database with the greatest frequency—in the context of the
      other entries that have already been made into the template—
      appear at the top of the drop-down list. The goal is to make
      it as simple as possible for metadata authors to fill in the
      templates, using as many entries from standard ontologies as
      they can, and to allow the authors to do so as quickly and as
      accurately as possible.</p>

      <p>The CEDAR team includes several groups who are helping to
      develop and evaluate our current system. For example, the
      Library of Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is a
      consortium of six Data and Signature Generation Centers
      (DSGCs) and a Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)
      in the United States. LINCS scientists use a variety of
      experimental techniques to study the consequences of
      disruption of biological pathways. LINCS has developed
      extensive metadata standards [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>], and the consortium is automating the
      process of data and metadata submission to the DCIC using
      CEDAR. CEDAR and the LINCS DCIC are collaborating to enable
      all six of the LINCS DSGCs to use the CEDARWorkbench for
      metadata management, standardization, and submission.</p>
      <p>The Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) community
      began in 2014 as an effort to bring together an international
      group of investigators utilizing high-throughput methods to
      study the immune response. The AIRR community has produced
      its own metadata standard for depositing data across four
      different data repositories at the U.S. National Center for
      Biotechnology Information (NCBI): BioProject, BioSample, SRA,
      and GenBank[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>].
      Unfortunately, none of the more than 30 databases managed by
      NCBI provides infrastructure for the curation of standardized
      metadata. AIRR is working with NCBI and with CEDAR in a
      project to allow users to submit controlled metadata to the
      NCBI. The AIRR community is beginning to use CEDAR technology
      to generate and upload its metadata. The NCBI is monitoring
      the AIRR activities to evaluate the potential use of CEDAR
      technology for the submission of metadata to all NCBI data
      repositories.</p>
      <p>Other collaborators are helping us to evaluate the CEDAR
      Workbench. They include the Protein Data Commons, under
      development by the U.S. National Cancer Institute; Stanford
      University Library, which is experimenting with the CEDAR
      Workbench as a tool for accessioning parts of its
      collections; and SimTK, a project that manages enormous
      amount of data related to the biomechanics of human
      mobility.</p>

      </header>
      <p>The benefits of open science depend on the availability of
      acessible, online datasets that are self-describing, using
      metadata based on standard frameworks and standard
      ontologies. CEDAR is a large, international collaboration
      that is working to develop open-source, Web-based tools and
      services that enable scientists to author and manage
      comprehensive metadata to annotate such datasets. Deployment
      of the CEDAR Workbench in several active research settings is
      enabling us to assess both the usability of our technology
      and its ability to enhance the metadata that allow
      experimental datasets to be identified, retrieved, and
      re-used by other investigators.</p>
