        <p><small>When an epidemic occurs, it is often impossible
        to vaccinate the entire population due to limited amount of
        resources. Therefore, it is of prime interest to identify
        the set of influential spreaders to immunize, in order to
        minimize both the cost of vaccine resource and the disease
        spreading. While various strategies based on the network
        topology have been introduced, few works consider the
        influence of the community structure in the epidemic
        spreading process. Nowadays, it is clear that many
        real-world networks exhibit an overlapping community
        structure, in which nodes are allowed to belong to more
        than one community. Previous work shows that the numbers of
        communities to which a node belongs is a good measure of
        its epidemic influence. In this work, we address the effect
        of nodes in the neighborhood of the overlapping nodes on
        epidemics spreading. The proposed immunization strategy
        provides highly connected neighbors of overlapping nodes in
        the network to immunize. The whole process requires
        information only at the node level and is well suited to
        large-scale networks. Extensive experiments on four
        real-world networks of diverse nature have been performed.
        Comparisons with alternative local immunization strategies
        using the fraction of the Largest Connected Component (LCC)
        after immunization,show that the proposed method is much
        more efficient. Additionally, it compares favorably to
        global measures such as degree and betweenness
        centrality.</small></p>

      <p>In <em>epidemiology</em>, an <strong>outbreak</strong> is
      a sudden increase in occurrences of a disease in a particular
      time and place. It may affect a small and localized group or
      impact upon thousands of people across an entire continent.
      The outbreaks of contagious diseases impose a tenacious and
      major threat to the lives of people all over the world. The
      impact of these diseases is immense and is felt across the
      world. These diseases not only effect the health of
      individuals directly, but also has an impact on societies,
      economies and political systems. They may lead the victim
      countries into economic crisis. Before these diseases turn
      into a critical state of affairs, it is required to come up
      with appropriate actions on time to arrest it. In order to be
      able to prevent the dreadful consequences of an infectious
      disease, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the
      behavior of its propagation [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>] in the social groups. lt is a
      crucial issue to come up with an approach to decelerate the
      contagion or to stop it completely, if possible [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>]. By
      vaccinating the people, it is possible to protect them and
      prevent them to transmit the disease among their contacts.
      But vaccination of entire population is nearly impossible to
      achieve and is not always feasible due to limited amount of
      vaccines and time. Thus targeted immunization strategies are
      the essential techniques to arrest the epidemic efficiently.
      An effective immunization strategy requires a mechanism to
      identify the influential spreaders so that the epidemic can
      be arrested by immunizing a small fraction of entire
      population[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. To be
      able to find the central individuals and to study the
      spreading trend of an infectious disease, we need a model
      that can be used to mimic the population and epidemic process
      in this population.</p>
      <p>A network representation can be used to model the disease
      spreading process by considering nodes as individuals and
      edges as interactions between them [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. The diffusion process can
      occur on networks of all kind such as social (e.g. epidemic),
      technological (e.g. computer viruses), etc. Instead of
      occurring randomly, epidemics tend to follow the structured
      pathways formed by the interactions and connections of the
      nodes in the network [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>].</p>
      <p>Immunization strategies can be classified into two
      categories: <em>global</em> or <em>local immunization
      strategy</em>.</p>
      <p><em>Global immunization strategies</em> require knowledge
      of the entire network in advance. Targeted immunization
      strategies based on centrality measures, such as degree
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>] and
      betweenness [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>]
      are typical examples of such strategies. In these methods a
      centrality value is computed for each node of the network.
      Then, all the nodes are ranked in descending order of their
      centrality values and the higher central nodes are selected
      for immunization. Most of the time it is very hard to get the
      precise information about the nodes’ contacts, which makes
      the global immunization completely impractical and
      unrealistic. On the other hand, <em>local immunization
      strategies</em> [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>] are more or less agnostic about the
      network structure. They require information only at node
      level to find the targeted nodes for immunization. For
      example, random immunization, where nodes are selected at
      random for immunization is the simplest local strategy. It
      does not require any information about the network structure.
      As local immunization strategies use only local information
      about the network they are preferred for large-scale and
      especially real-world social networks where the topologies
      are usually unknown.</p>
      <p>According to recent research <strong>overlapping community
      structure</strong>, plays a crucial role in epidemic
      spreading [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>,

      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>]. Although,
      there is no clear definition of a community structure, it is
      very often apprehended as the division of network vertices
      into subgroups (communities), where intra community nodes are
      densely connected, but inter community nodes are sparsely
      connected to each other. In networks, with non-overlapping
      community structure a node belongs to a single community,
      while it can be shared with different communities in networks
      having overlapping community structures. Most real-world
      social networks are structured in communities that are
      overlapping in nature. For example, if we consider a
      population as a network, an individual may belong to more
      than one circle, like friends circle, family circle,
      classmates circle, etc. . Considering a network of actors, an
      actor may play in movies of various genres (Musical, Action,
      Adventure, Comedy, Crime, Drama, Fantasy, Historical,
      etc).</p>
      <p>In this paper, we propose an immunization method which has
      advantage of the role of neighbors of the overlapping nodes
      in epidemic dynamics. Since this method does not require
      complete information of the network, we claim it to be a
      local immunization method.</p>
      <p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section
      2 we recall briefly the related works. Section 3 introduces
      the proposed immunization strategy. Section 4 presents
      experimental results to evaluate its effectiveness as
      compared to both local alternative immunization strategies as
      well as prominent global strategies. Section 5 draws the
      conclusion.</p>

      <p>The objective of targeted immunization strategies is to
      uncover a set of the most influential nodes in a given
      network. Based on the amount of information they need about
      the overall network topology, they can be classified into two
      groups : <strong>Global and Local</strong>. Immunization
      strategies that require information of the entire network
      structure are said to be <em>Global Strategies</em> while
      strategies requiring knowledge of network topology only at
      node level, are classified as <em>Local Strategies</em>. The
      most widely known global strategies together with alternative
      influent local strategies are recalled. Indeed, they will be
      used in order to compare their efficiency with the proposed
      strategy.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The immunization strategies in this class aim to assign
        a rank to all the nodes in the network and to immunize them
        according to their rank. Thus for each node of the network,
        a so-called centrality measure reflecting its ability to
        propagate the disease is computed. The ranks are assigned
        in decreasing order from most central to less central node.
        In these strategies knowledge of the entire network is
        required because all the nodes are involved in the process.
        Usually, global strategies perform better than local
        strategies because they can use more information about the
        network topology. Degree and Betweenness centrality are the
        most influential global strategies that are used usually
        for comparative purposes.</p>

          <p>The degree of a node is the number of its immediate
          neighbors. Nodes having high degree measures are
          considered to be more influential and are selected for
          immunization [12] . In this method the degree of all the
          nodes in the network are computed and they are assigned a
          rank based on their degree. Nodes are then immunized in
          the decreasing order of degree values. The degree
          immunization strategy is efficient in scale-free networks
          even when a small percentage of population is
          immunized[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

          betweenness centrality of a node is the number of times
          an information passes through a particular node, if it
          flows through the network. In this strategy, the nodes
          are selected for immunization based on their overall
          betweenness centrality. This strategy is among the most
          efficient global strategy, however it suffers from a high
          time complexity.</p>

        characteristic prohibit their use in large scale real-world
        networks. Local immunization strategies require less
        information and are computationally more efficient. We
        recall two methods that try to target the most highly
        connected nodes for immunization (Acquaintance immunization
        and Threaded-Tree Immunization) and two methods that take
        advantage of the community structure to select the
        immunized nodes (Community Bridge Finder and Membership
        Immunization).</p>

          data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
          data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] refers
          to choosing a random fraction of the nodes and looking
          for one of their neighbor or acquaintance at random. The
          acquaintances are immunized rather than the originally
          chosen nodes. This strategy is based on the fact that
          randomly selected acquaintances possess more links than
          randomly selected nodes. The Acquaintance immunization
          algorithm works as follows: first a random node
          <em>v</em> <sub>0</sub> is picked, and then one of its
          acquaintance, <em>v</em> <sub>1</sub> is picked at
          random. The nodes which are picked as acquaintances at
          least <em>n</em> times are immunized. For <em>n</em> = 1
          the acquaintances are directly immunized. The strategy
          requires only information about randomly selected nodes
          and their immediate neighborhood . It identifies highly
          connected nodes without any information about the global
          structure of the network.</p>

          the highly connected nodes by exploring the neighborhood
          of randomly selected nodes. It assumes that high degree
          nodes will appear more frequently in the neighborhoods.
          The process begins with an initial node selected at
          random. It is queried to get some neighbor nodes and then
          those neighbors are queried instead. A record is made to
          log the inquiry frequency of each node and the process
          above is performed recursively.The algorithm performs as
          follows:</p>
          <p>Step 1: Start from node <em>i</em> in the network.
          Query <em>i</em> to get <em>n</em> neighbors, denoted by
          <em>i</em> <sub>1</sub>, <em>i</em> <sub>2</sub>, ...,
          <em>i<sub>n</sub></em> ;</p>
          <p>Step 2: Keep querying each node obtained above, and
          get <em>n</em> neighbors of each of them.</p>
          <p>Step 3: Repeat the iteration for <em>t</em> time
          steps. Record the inquiry frequency of each node.</p>
          <p>Step 4: Take <em>m</em> nodes queried most frequently
          and immunize them.</p>
          <p>It does not require global information about the
          network topology. Indeed, each node needs to figure out
          only local information about its neighborhood. This
          strategy is more effective than acquaintance
          immunization, especially when few nodes are
          immunized.</p>

          <p>The Community Bridge Finder algorithm (CBF), proposed

          "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>], is a random walk based
          algorithm, aimed at identifying nodes connected to
          multiple communities. It is based on the idea that the
          first node not connecting back to already visited nodes
          of a current random walk is more likely to belong to a
          different community.The algorithm starts by selecting a
          random node. Then, a random path is followed until a node
          is found that is not connected to more than one of the
          previously visited nodes on the random walk. This node is
          identified as a potential Community bridge. Two of its
          neighbors are then selected at random. If none of them is
          connected to a previously visited node, the potential
          community bridge is as a valid bridge. It is immunized.
          This strategy does not use any information about the
          network structure. Note it has been designed in the
          context of non-overlapping communities.</p>

          targets the so-called structural hubs. In a network with
          overlapping community structure, structural hubs are the
          overlapping nodes that belong to a high number of
          communities. Through those nodes the epidemic can
          propagate easily to a greater number of communities. When
          the community structure is known, the overlapping nodes
          are immunized in descending order of their Membership
          number, i.e., the number of communities to which they
          belong. If the community structure is unknown, a local
          community detection method is used to identify the
          overlapping nodes. This strategy compares favorably with
          global strategies especially at high infection rates and
          for dense communities.</p>

          <p>Random Walk Overlap Selection (RWOS) targets the
          overlapping nodes with high degree [<a class="bib"
          data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
          data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>] . With
          a list of overlapping nodes in hand, RWOS performs a
          random-walk starting from a random node of the network.
          At each step, if a visited node is in the list of
          overlapping nodes, it is nominated as a target node for
          immunization, otherwise, the random-walk proceeds. This
          process continues until the desired immunization coverage
          is reached. In fact, this strategy try to immunize the
          overlapping nodes according to their degree centrality.
          Indeed, the probability of visiting a node in a random
          walk is proportional to its degree. As for membership
          immunization, if the overlapping nodes are unknown, a
          local community detection algorithm is used.</p>

      <p>Many real-world networks, such as Internet, the World-Wide
      Web, protein interaction networks exhibit an heterogeneous
      degree distribution. The vast majority of nodes have few
      connexions while a small percentage of nodes are highly
      connected to their neighbors. These hubs that have a huge
      amount of direct connections to other nodes in the network
      are very influential spreaders and they need to be identified
      and immunized. In community-structured networks, overlapping
      nodes are also influential spreaders, even though they may
      not have high degree. Indeed, they act as bridges between
      communities. This is the reason why several methods have been
      proposed that make use of overlapping nodes in order to
      control epidemic spreading [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>] .</p>
      <p>The proposed strategy <em>Overlap Neighborhood</em> also
      takes advantage of the overlapping nodes. Rather than
      immunizing them, it selects immediate neighbors of
      overlapping nodes for immunization. It is local, unaware of
      global knowledge of the network, and in order to identify
      influential spreaders for immunization, it only requires the
      information at the node level. The idea behind our strategy
      is based on the definition of overlapping community -
      <em>i.e., within community nodes are densely connected to
      each other as compared to nodes in other communities.</em>.
      Since, overlapping nodes are part of more than one community,
      and real-world networks have few hubs, there is higher
      probability that these hubs are neighbors of the overlapping
      nodes in their respective communities. So, through the
      overlapping nodes we can target these influential nodes
      (nodes having high degrees) in their respective communities
      for immunization. Targeting these hubs allows to brake the
      communities in smaller subgraph (need not to be connected).
      In order to get a better understanding of the concept behind
      this strategy, we refer to Fig 1. In this figure a toy
      network is used to explain how overlapping nodes can help
      targeting the influential nodes within the communities.
      Immunizing these nodes allows to break the communities into
      small connected or disconnected components, and consequently
      the all networks split in many components. In Fig. <a class=
      "fig" href="#fig1">1</a> overlapping nodes are the nodes with
      red color. They belong to the two communities represented by
      the dotted circles. Their immediate neighbors are the nodes
      numbered (1, 8, 11, and 13). According to the definition of
      overlapping community structure, these nodes tend to be the
      nodes with the higher degree value. If these neighbors are
      immunized, the largest connected component in the network is
      of size two. Note, it makes sense that being members of
      multiple communities, overlapping nodes have high probability
      to be connected to high degree nodes in several of their
      communities.</p>
      <p>Given the network and the overlapping nodes, the proposed
      strategy works as follows:</p>
      <p>Step 1. Each overlapping nodes are queried to find its
      immediate neighbors.</p>
      <p>Step 2. All the obtained neighbors are ranked according to
      their degrees.</p>
      <p>Step 3. Immunize the required fraction of these ranked
      nodes in descending order of their degrees for immunization.
      The algorithm in pseudo-code for the proposed strategy is
      reported in <strong>Algorithm 1.</strong></p>

        <p>Selecting appropriate datasets is essential to analyze
        the performance of the various methods. As we want to
        evaluate global and local immunization strategies, we need
        to restrict our attention to networks with a size
        compatible with our computational constraints.
        Unfortunately, this prohibits using available real-world
        networks with ground-truth community structure. We have
        selected 4 real-word datasets frequently used in the
        literature (two collaboration networks among scientists, a
        communication network and a technological network). As the
        community structure of these networks is unknown, the
        Speaker Listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA)
        algorithm is used to uncover the communities and the
        overlapping nodes [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        <p>In this section the proposed method is compared with two
        global methods (degree and betweenness) and four local
        methods (acquaintance with <em>n</em> = 2, CBF, RWOS and
        membership). For a given fraction of immunized nodes the
        LCC fraction value after immunization allows to compare the
        effectiveness of the various methods. Indeed the LCC is the
        upper bound of the epidemic outbreak.</p>

        <p>Fig. <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> reports the LCC
        fraction versus the fraction of immunized nodes for the
        immunization strategies under study and the four datasets.
        Results clearly show that we can generally distinguish two
        classes of methods in terms of performances. The first
        class is made of the global methods (betweeness and degree)
        together with Overlap Neighborhood, while the second class
        regroup the alternative local methods. Indeed, Overlap
        Neighborhood produces LCC comparable to global strategies
        for all immunization coverage values. Whatever the dataset,
        the first class of methods outperforms the second one in a
        wide range of immunized fraction. These results confirm our
        intuition that overlapping nodes are more likely to be
        connected with the high degree nodes of their communities.
        Hence, they allow to target the most central nodes (in
        terms of degree) from the communities for immunization in
        their local neighborhood. This is the reason why
        performances are very similar to the degree immunization
        strategy. Note, it is done without having knowledge of the
        entire network topology. Whereas, for selecting the same
        influential nodes, degree immunization needs to inspect the
        degree of all the nodes. Overall, the proposed method
        targets the higher degree nodes in the network with the
        only knowledge of its overlapping nodes and local
        information about their neighborhood. Now, we have a broad
        picture, let us look at the results in more details. Fig.
        <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> (a), reports the results
        for Enron-Email network. In this case we can classify the
        methods into three classes of various efficiency. The first
        class that contains the most efficient immunization
        strategies contains Degree, Betweenness and Overlap
        Neighborhood. Note that Degree and Overlap Neighborhood
        perform identically when the fraction of immunized nodes
        immunized is lower than 7%, while Betweenness is slightly
        more efficient. Above this value Overlap Neighborhood and
        degree are more efficient than betweenness. Acquaintance
        and CBF form a homogeneous second group with very similar
        performances. Although, they are less efficient than the
        first group their effect is noticeable. Finally, the third
        group is composed with membership and RWOS. For this
        network both are performing poorly.</p>
        <p>Results of the experiments with the collaboration
        networks are reported respectively in Fig. <a class="fig"
        href="#fig2">2</a> (b) for the GR-QC network and Fig.
        <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> (c) for the HEP network.
        They are very consistent. Indeed, we observe similar
        behavior of the immunization strategies for both datasets.
        The most efficient method is betweenness when a small
        fraction of nodes is immunized (until 10% for GR-QC and 12%
        for HEP). It is closely followed by Overlap Neighborhood.
        Degree is one step behind. When the fraction of immunized
        nodes increases Overlap Neighborhood becomes the most
        efficient method. The local methods (membership,
        acquaintance and CBF) are clearly less performing even
        though their performances increases with the fraction of
        nodes to be immunized. Acquaintance always outperforms
        membership and CBS. These results suggest that highly
        connected nodes are more important than bridges between
        communities to prevent the epidemic spreading. RWOS is in
        between those two extremes. When the fraction of immunized
        node is low, it behaves like the global methods. As this
        fraction increases its behavior is more similar than the
        other classical local immunization strategies.</p>
        <p>Finally Fig. <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> (d)
        presents the simulation result for the Power Grid network.
        In this case we can clearly consider two groups. The most
        performing strategies composed by two local strategies
        (Overlap Neighborhood and RWOS) and the two global
        strategies (degree and betweenness) and the less performing
        ones represented by membership, acquaintance and CBF. Note
        that Overlap Neighborhood that up to almost 6% of
        immunization the proposed strategy outperforms all the
        local methods and it is almost similar to betweenness. But
        above a fraction of 6% it even surpasses the performance of
        betweenness. To summarize, Overlap Neighborhood outperforms
        all the local strategies for which we have conducted the
        experiments. Its performances are comparable to global
        immunization strategies such as degree and betweenness.
        When the fraction of nodes to immunize increases it can
        even surpass the performance of betweenness. All this is
        obtained with few efforts. Indeed, there is no need of the
        global information about network topology.One just has to
        know the overlapping nodes and their neighborhood.</p>

          Conclusions</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>An immunization strategy taking advantage of the
      overlapping community structure observed in many real-world
      networks is proposed. It aims to target the highly connected
      neighbors of the overlapping nodes for immunization. The
      so-called Overlap neighborhood immunization method has been
      empirically evaluated with four real-world networks.
      Experimental results are very promising. Indeed, they show
      the efficiency of the proposed strategy as compared to both
      alternative local methods and global ones. Indeed Overlap
      Neighborhood outperforms all the compared local strategies.
      Additionally, it compares favorably with global centrality
      methods such as degree and betweenness. Its main advantage is
      that it is local and does not require the knowledge of the
      whole network topology. The results confirm the importance of
      the community structure in order to design more efficient
      immunization strategies. The results obtained so far are
      promising, but there is a long way to go in order to get a
      clear idea of how the community structures impact the
      spreading process. We need to extend this preliminary work in
      two directions. First of all, more experiments involving new
      real-world datasets need to be done in order to confirm the
      effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Synthetic benchmark
      graph with controlled properties have to be used in order to
      get a clearer understanding of the role of the overlapping
      nodes in the epidemic process. The second direction is to
      conduct experiments with various community detection
      algorithms in order to evaluate the influence of the
      uncertainties linked to the identification of the overlapping
      nodes.</p>
