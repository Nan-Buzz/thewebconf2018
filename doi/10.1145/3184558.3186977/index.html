        <p><small>Having a thorough understanding of energy
        consumption behavior is an important element of
        sustainability studies. Traditional sources of information
        about energy consumption, such as smart meter devices and
        surveys, can be costly to deploy, may lack contextual
        information or have infrequent updates. In this paper, we
        examine the possibility of extracting energy
        consumption-related information from user-generated
        content. More specifically, we develop a pipeline that
        helps identify energy-related content in Twitter posts and
        classify it into four categories (dwelling, food, leisure,
        and mobility), according to the type of activity performed.
        We further demonstrate a web-based application – called
        <em>Social Smart Meter</em> – that implements the proposed
        pipeline and enables different stakeholders to gain an
        insight into daily energy consumption behavior, as well as
        showcase it in case studies involving several world

          Introduction</h2>

      </header>
      <p>The performance of day-to-day human activities requires
      considerable amounts of different forms of energy. People
      consume energy resources while utilizing various home
      appliances, but also while moving from home to work or to
      other places relating to leisure activities. Energy
      consumption levels increase in places where people
      agglomerate, such as in cities and metropolitan regions. In
      shaping sustainable energy systems, it is important to gain
      an insight into individual energy consumption
      behavior&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>].</p>
      <p>Such insights can be used to raise awareness about energy
      consumption &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] or to inform policies about how
      energy is being consumed. However, the variety of energy
      forms, in combination with the multitude of human activities,
      renders the quantitative measurement of individual
      consumption behavior non-trivial.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, measurements of energy consumption are
      derived primarily from two sources: 1) <em>Smart meters</em>:
      Sensor devices that record and measure consumption of –
      primarily electric – energy in different time intervals; and
      2) <em>Surveys</em>: Questionnaires or structured interviews
      (e.g. household travel surveys), focusing on qualitative
      characteristics of energy consumption behavior
      &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>].
      While being the gold standard when it comes to reliable
      quantitative measurements of and qualitative information
      about energy consumption, such data sources also have several
      drawbacks. Smart meters are costly to deploy, and the data
      they generate are usually proprietary and lack contextual
      information. Surveys, though semantically rich, are costly,
      non-scalable, and infrequently conducted.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the proliferation of social data has
      given rise to a new source of information about peoples’
      daily spatiotemporal behavior [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. While other sources, such as mobile
      phones, satellite imagery, and traffic sensors are
      increasingly used in deriving information about energy
      consumption behavior, in this work we focus on user-generated
      content from social media. Although biased and noisy, data
      from these sources are becoming widely available, inexpensive
      to collect, dynamic and frequently updated. Given that they
      are the byproduct of – or refer to – daily human activities,
      it is reasonable to assume that information about energy
      consumption could be embedded in their semantic
      signatures.</p>
      <p><strong>Contribution</strong>. In this demo, we introduce
      <em>Social Smart Meter</em>, a web-based application that
      offers different users the opportunity to gain an insight
      into four types of energy consumption behavior (dwelling,
      food, leisure, and mobility), calculated at the neighborhood
      level. The demo showcases the extent to which data from
      social media could be used as a complementary source of
      information about individual energy consumption behavior in
      several world cities such as Amsterdam, Jakarta, and
      Boston.</p>

      <p>Social Smart Meter aims to identify energy-related content
      in social media posts and further classify it into four
      categories, namely:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="•"><em>Dwelling</em>: it refers to
        the consumption of energy due to the usage of home
        appliances (e.g., washing machine, gaming
        console)<br /></li>
        <li id="list2" label="•"><em>Food</em>: it refers to the
        use of resources associated with the preparation and
        processing of food.<br /></li>
        <li id="list3" label="•"><em>Mobility</em>: it refers the
        energy required for moving from one place to
        another.<br /></li>
        <li id="list4" label="•"><em>Leisure</em>: it refers to the
        energy required for performing leisure activities (e.g.,
        watching TV, playing video-games, partying)<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>These categories cover a considerable spectrum of the
      activities impacting on the energy footprint of an
      individual's lifestyle&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>].</p>
      <p>As shown in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>, the
      proposed pipeline can be divided into an <em>offline</em> and
      an <em>online</em> mode. In the offline mode, social media
      posts are collected and used for training a classifier. Given
      that manual annotation of the posts is not scalable, we use a
      distant supervision learning approach. The labeling function
      is a hybrid dictionary-similarity heuristic, in which a post
      is annotated according to a dictionary, as well as according
      to the similarity of the training dataset to a set of
      energy-related posts. In the online mode, the Social Smart
      Meter web-application is deployed. The application identifies
      in real time social media posts relating to a particular
      energy consumption activity, while also performing
      statistical analyses that are fed to an interactive
      visualization.</p>

        <p>In this work we use Twitter as a source of social media
        data mainly for two reasons: it provides easy access to the
        data through the Stream API; and, it often collects content
        that people post on other social networks (e.g. music
        consumption, gaming activities, visit of places). We are
        only interested in geo-referenced posts, so the tweets are
        collected by querying the Twitter Stream API using a
        bounding box corresponding to the area of interest.</p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">2.2</span> Annotation
            and classification of tweets</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>In the past, distant supervision learning has been
        successfully used for classifying Twitter content (e.g.
        detection of political trends&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]). In our work we use a
        hybrid dictionary-similarity distant supervision. The main
        intuition is that using only a dictionary might lead to a
        highly noisy dataset, especially in short texts like
        tweets, since a single word can have different meanings
        according to the context. Examples include slang words or
        proverbs (e.g., “pot calling the kettle black”).</p>
        <p>The process for the creation of the training data
        considers two sets: 1) <em>Dictionary</em>: a set of terms
        related to a specific consumption type – e.g. ingredients
        or cooking utensils are associated with the <em>food</em>
        category. And 2) <em>Seeds</em>: a set of relevant tweets
        for a specific energy consumption type. This set is
        manually built by selecting the tweets from the ones
        retrieved in the data collection step.</p>
        <p>Both the <em>Dictionary</em> and the <em>Seeds</em>
        datasets are language dependent. For machine learning
        purposes, the considered features are: 1) the vector
        representation of the tweets obtained by training a
        <tt>Doc2Vec</tt> model on the tweets corpus; and 2) the
        vector representation of the words obtained from the
        pre-trained <tt>Word2Vec</tt> model on the Google News
        corpus&nbsp;<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
        "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>The process starts by retrieving a set of candidate
        tweets, considering the ones that contain a
        <em>dictionary</em> term. Then it computes the similarity
        between the candidates and the centroid of the
        <em>seeds</em>. Given a confidence range [<em>h</em>,
        <em>l</em>], it labels as positive example the tweets whose
        similarity is greater than <em>h</em>, and as negative if
        it's lower then <em>l</em>, leaving the others
        unlabeled.</p>
        <p>Then, the pipeline includes a module devoted to
        dictionary expansion. This is to account for
        incompleteness, either due to the labor-intensiveness of
        the manual creation of an extensive set of words related to
        a particular energy consumption type, or due to the lack of
        knowledge about all the relevant terms. A set of candidate
        words is created by taking all the terms contained in
        tweets labeled as positive. Then, the process considers a
        word valid if a dictionary term appears on the list of
        similar words obtained from the <tt>Word2Vec</tt> model.
        The main intuition is that, in this way, we are able to
        select only the words that belong to the same context of
        the dictionary. The process is iterated until either all
        the tweets are labeled, or no more candidate tweets can be
        found.</p>
        <p>Finally, the annotated dataset is used to train a
        classifier for each of the energy consumption types. We
        employ a logistic regression classifier, using as feature
        the vector representation obtained from the
        <tt>Doc2Vec</tt> model.</p>
        <p><strong>Annotation Performance</strong>. We collected
        219,436 geo-referenced tweets in forty days through the
        Twitter Stream API without any keyword filtering. The
        collection has been performed between Jan. 23, 2017 and
        Feb. 26, 2017, within the bounding box area of Amsterdam.
        The starting dictionaries were created (both in English and
        Dutch) by manually adding words and crawling e-commerce
        website and Wikipedia pages. The tweets were annotated with
        the process described in the previous section.</p>
        <p>Next, we trained the logistic regression classifiers.
        Given that the positive and negative examples were not
        balanced, we attempted to balance the dataset by randomly
        sampling 100,000 tweets for the training set and 1000 for
        the test set.</p>
        <p>Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> and Table
        <a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a> summarize the obtained
        results, respectively in terms of dictionary size and
        classifiers performance. Our approach led to and increase
        of the dictionary size by about ten times. This step is
        essential in our methodology, as it is unlikely for a
        single person to build, even with the help of external
        sources, an appropriate dictionary, and to maintain it. The
        performance of both the tested classifiers is promising,
        with satisfactory AUC ROC and accuracy values.</p>

        <p>Social Smart Meter uses the annotated tweets to perform
        a series of analyses. It aggregates the tweets into various
        spatial units (e.g., neighborhoods, census tracts, postcode
        areas, etc..) and into hourly time slots. These
        aggregations helps observe the concentration of different
        types of energy consumption activities at various scales
        and times of the day.</p>
        <p>To better characterize a specific energy consumption
        type, Social Smart Meter computes the frequency of
        occurrence of relevant terms, aggregated by area and time.
        Moreover, for the mobility energy consumption type, it
        calculates the user displacement and radius of gyration as
        implemented in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        <p>Social Smart Meter provides views to explore the
        extracted information. In particular, it projects the
        overall energy consumption onto a map (Figure <a class=
        "fig" href="#fig2">2</a>). The color of the different areas
        corresponds to the amount of energy consumption registered,
        measured as the number of tweets posted in each zone. The
        pie chart shows the percentage of the different energy
        consumption types. It, further, shows the same information
        (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>) for each
        energy consumption type, together with a histogram of the
        most frequent terms appearing in the tweet. Moreover, for
        the <em>Mobility</em> type, as depicted in Figure <a class=
        "fig" href="#fig3">3</a>(d), it shows the histograms of the
        user displacement and radius of gyration. All the
        visualizations allow to filter the statistics by area and
        time range.</p>

          Meter Architecture</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The Social Smart Meter is implemented in Python. The
      tweets annotation phase uses the <em>gensim</em><a class="fn"
      href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> package for
      handling the Word2Vec and the Doc2Vec models. The web
      application is built using the Python microframework
      Flask<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
      "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> shows the
      Social Smart Meter architecture. First, the Twitter Stream
      API is used to retrieve the geo-referenced tweets within a
      specific area. The tweets are, then, classified using the
      model trained in the <em>offline</em> phase (Figure <a class=
      "fig" href="#fig1">1</a>); non-relevant tweets are discarded,
      while the relevant ones are stored in a MongoDB database.
      Next, the <em>Energy Behavior Analytics</em> module
      periodically analyzes tweets, as described in Section
      <a class="sec" href="#sec-8">2.3</a>. The tweets are
      aggregated into spatial units (also stored in the database),
      while calculating term frequencies, user displacement, and
      the radius of gyration. These statistics are accessible
      through a Web API, which is used by the <em>Views</em>
      component to build the visualizations.</p>

          Future Work</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In this paper, we described a pipeline that identifies and
      classifies energy consumption-related content in
      user-contibuted posts, with emphasis on Twitter. We further
      demonstrated how the proposed pipeline is implemented in the
      <em>Social Smart Meter</em> Web application, and instantiated
      over several world cities.</p>
      <p>Future work will emphasize the effectiveness of the
      proposed pipeline and web application, with regard to
      estimating energy consumption behavior from social media.
      Particular attention will be given to precision, with
      emphasis on the value of the confidence interval in the
      annotation phase, the size of the initial seed set, feature
      engineering (using e.g. Word2Vec, TF-IDF, n-grams etc.), and
      the use of other classifiers. We also aim to test the
      adaptability of the pipeline, by deriving data from different
      social media platforms (e.g. Instagram). The correspondence
      between energy consumption information identified in social
      media and that from traditional sources (e.g. smart meters,
      household travel surveys) will serve as a validation of our
      approach, subject to availability of fine-grained (i.e. at a
      similar spatiotemporal resolution) energy data. We will
      investigate methods to link social media posts with concrete
      values of energy consumption (in terms of e.g. kWh or
      <em>CO</em> <sub>2</sub> emissions). Moreover, we aim to test
      the scalability of the proposed pipeline, by deploying it in
      different urban and regional contexts.</p>
