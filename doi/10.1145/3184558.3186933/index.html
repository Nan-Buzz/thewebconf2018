Unblocked websites or web pages always accompany couple fate-to-fail links from blocked servers due to such restrictions, while users wait for a long time to see contents of these blocked/<em>invalid</em> links. Therefore, it is better to directly show timeout links to users for better experiences rather than making users excessively wait .</small>    </p>    <p>     <small>In this paper, we present <tt>LinCa</tt> (Links Catcher), a novel approach that fully considers the Internet access restriction and reduces page loading time on client-side by parsing all HTTP requests, and intercepting all invalid links when a web navigation starts. Thus, we first create and maintain a <em>Rule Base</em> to store invalid links under given access restriction rules. We then update the Rule Base periodically to cover as many invalid links as possible and remove links that become valid. We finally demonstrate the effectiveness of <tt>LinCa</tt> through experiments by building and deploying a Chrome extension.

And increasingly complex network environment only drives institutions and organizations to deploy more access restrictions to secure their environments and to protect their data from malware and hackers. One consequential inconvenience caused by Internet access restriction is the latency on page loading. Amongst requested resources, some may locate on blocked servers although majority of them are not. While no mechanism to validate the accessibility of servers before browser requests, a browser has to call unreachable servers for resources and to wait for responses till timeout. Then requests will be terminated and failed status will be confirmed. This pattern repeats for same situations, with CPU resources wasted and users&#x2019; patience consumed.</p>    <p>Previous works that analyzed page loading time in different perspectives&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>], did not consider Internet access restriction. Although some have considered latency problems&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>], most of them gave solutions for web developers instead of users&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. Whereas no work, to the best of our knowledge, addresses it in formality, we find approaches to a similar problem on online advertisements &#x2013; research on studying the mechanism of online ad-blockers where scholars found the approach on javascript-injected advertisements is blocking them from being loaded&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>].</p>    <p>We address the problem of Internet access restrictions: namely how browsers inefficiently load pages containing third-party resources which are blocked at the network level. Therefore, we propose <tt>LinCa</tt> and identify the major factors on page loading latency subject to Internet access restrictions. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is one of the first attempts to formally address this from the client side.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-3">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> Method and Architecture</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>First, we give an analysis of <tt>LinCa</tt>. A link is described as <em>invalid</em> if it is sent to a server whose returned HTTP status message is either a failed status with undefined response type or an error response. Otherwise, requests that result in responses excluding client and server error responses are coined <em>non-invalid</em>.</p>    <p>    <tt>LinCa</tt> blocks invalid links by setting up a user-oriented <em>Rule Base</em>, which composes of one regular expression table and a hash table. The scenario is under an Internet access restriction where users are denied access to a given set of hosts or servers by ISP (Internet Service Provider). We argue that size of the set is rather dynamic instead of static, with new servers or hosts can be appended or removed. So we use local storage for invalid requests which will not be responded and have been taking up the relevant resources. And we update the user&#x0027;s Rule Base from the user&#x0027;s own web browsing data. A blocked domain often associates with multifold addresses. Addresses with same domain can be labeled by same regular expression to avoid redundancy and reduce storage space. For addresses that cannot be expressed in regular expression, such as short URLs, we set up a hash table to store them to support quick search. User-oriented approach on designing storage strategy meets the needs of storing invalid links for a given user while maintaining a minimized storage space locally. With different Internet access restrictions, users&#x2019; Rule Bases may vary.</p>    <p>Before being sent out by a browser, all requests will be intercepted to extract addresses of requested links. Then, the extracted link is used as input to the Rule Base for pairing invalid ones. Any yielded output will designate <tt>LinCa</tt> to intercept the about-to-send request to achieve invalid link block. Once a page finishes loading, all released links will be revised for accessibility to update Rule Base by appending unlisted invalid links and removing listed ones which become non-invalid. A time-to-expire tag is appended to each invalid link to maintain effectiveness and space minimization. During links revision, <tt>LinCa</tt> checks expired invalid links for accessibility. Inaccessible ones&#x2019; tag will be reset while accessible removed from Rule Base. In Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>, we present the work-flow of <tt>LinCa</tt>. In summary, the core procedures of <tt>LinCa</tt> are as follows:</p>    <p>1) The Rule Base for Invalid Links Storage</p>    <p>2) The Capture of Website Request</p>    <p>3) The Identification and Block of Invalid Links</p>    <p>4) The Self-adaptive Mechanism for Rule Base <figure id="fig1">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186933/images/www18companion-173-fig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 1"      longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Flow Chart of Web Page Loading Time Optimization Principle</span>     </div>    </figure>    </p>   </section>   <section id="sec-4">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">3</span> Experiments</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>We examined top 400 websites &#x2013; ranked by Amazon&#x0027;s Alexa. Collected statistics show that 62.53% of average page loading time is consumed by invalid requests, whose average processing time is 7.91 times longer than that of valid ones.</p>    <p>We then implemented a Google Chrome extension <tt>LinCa</tt> to demonstrate the efficiency of optimization on page loading time. Experiments are conducted to test the overall effect of reduced page loading time latency and requests loss which are essential for user experience on the web.</p>    <p>Experiments were conducted on a Windows 7 computer with Intel Core i5-4570 CPU and 2GB memory. Internet access restrictions we chose are a campus Internet in China for both university and nation deployed firewalls. We installed our extension in this computer&#x0027;s Chrome with version 49.0.2623.110.</p>    <p>The efficiency of <tt>LinCa</tt> on page loading time optimization is proved by experiments using a Google Chrome extension we built. Results demonstrate a reduced page loading time with average 28.12% of original page loading time after using <tt>LinCa</tt> while only sacrifice about 2.15% of non-invalid requests. Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> displays the results. The average page loading time of our tested websites subject to Internet access restriction is reduced from 43530 ms to 12241 ms by using <tt>LinCa</tt>. The experiment we run shows positive results with effectively reduced page loading time and negligible requests loss rate. We also conducted a survey of 105 volunteers in our lab to receive feedback. <figure id="fig2">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186933/images/www18companion-173-fig2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 2"      longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Average overall page loading time and request processing time illustrate the efficiency of LinCa.
