        <p><small>The <em>Physical Semantic Web</em> (PSW) is a
        novel paradigm built upon the Google Physical Web (PW)
        approach and devoted to improve the quality of interactions
        in the Web of Things. Beacons expose semantic annotations
        instead of basic identifiers, <em>i.e.</em>,
        machine-understandable descriptions of physical resources.
        This enables novel ontology-based object advertisement and
        discovery and –in turn– advanced user-to-thing and
        autonomous thing-to-thing interactions.</small></p>
        <p><small>The demo shows the evolution from the PW to the
        PSW in a discovery scenario set in a winery, where bottles
        are equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and a
        customer can discover them using her smartphone. The final
        goal is to prove benefits of PSW over basic PW, including:
        rich semantic-based object annotation; dynamic annotations
        exploiting on-board sensors; enhanced discovery and ranking
        of nearby objects through semantic matchmaking;
        availability of interactions even without working Internet
        infrastructure, by means of point-to-point data

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The <em>Physical Web</em><a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> (PW) [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] is a framework for the
      Internet of Things (IoT), proposed by Google Inc. and devoted
      to implement direct users-to-things interactions. This
      paradigm is based on resource discovery enabling mobile
      personal devices (<em>e.g.</em>, smartphones) to retrieve
      Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) of nearby objects through
      the <em>Eddystone</em> Bluetooth beacon protocol<a class="fn"
      href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Finding URLs via
      Wi-Fi through <em>multicast DNS</em> (mDNS) and <em>Universal
      Plug and Play</em> (uPnP) is also supported. The approach
      does not require directory services, as smart objects are
      associated to unambiguous Web addresses.</p>
      <p>Although such an approach promotes human-to-thing
      communication (providing indubitable benefits to end users
      from a direct interaction with pervasive computing contexts),
      there are some significant issues penalizing a full adoption
      of the Google PW framework in advanced applications.
      Particularly: i) apart from the early Bluetooth-based
      discovery, further interactions require a mandatory Internet
      connection to the Web; ii) direct thing-to-thing
      communication is not allowed yet; iii) discovery mechanisms
      are too simplistic to cope with typical interoperability and
      unpredictability problems in the IoT. The <em>Physical
      Semantic Web</em> (PSW) [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] proposal improves upon the PW by
      associating semantic annotations to object beacons instead of
      trivial identifiers, <em>i.e.</em>, machine-understandable
      descriptions in standard Semantic Web languages. Therefore
      object advertisement and discovery are enhanced and things
      can communicate among them through proper software agents
      without user mediation.</p>
      <p>The PSW approach preserves the original Eddystone-URL
      beacons discovery, so legacy applications are still
      supported. Furthermore, in the PSW each URL could
      alternatively target: i) a basic Web page; ii) an annotated
      Web page, where users may view contents and/or exploit
      metadata semantics; iii) a semantic annotation to be directly
      processed by software agents locally.</p>
      <p>Object discovery ensues from a semantic matchmaking
      process [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>],
      able to compare a request (<em>i.e.</em>, user or object
      profile) with several beacon annotations, referred to the
      same ontology. For each ⟨user/object profile, resource⟩ pair,
      a matchmaking score measures the relevance of the retrieved
      beacon w.r.t. request annotation. Concept Abduction and
      Contraction non-standard inferences [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] theoretically ground the
      PSW discovery and provide also an outcome explanation
      capability: it evidences compatible, incompatible and missing
      elements, so as to eventually refine the original query.</p>
      <p>The proposed demo shows the evolution from the PW to the
      PSW in a four-step experience, as outlined in Section
      <a class="sec" href="#sec-9">2</a>. The reference scenario is
      set in a winery, where bottles available for sale are
      equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and a
      customer can discover them using a smartphone. Discussion in
      Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-14">3</a> highlights how
      relevant elements of the demo setup help understand both
      potentialities and benefits of the PSW proposal if compared
      with standard PW.</p>

      </header>
      <p>The demonstration consists of a mobile application,
      showcasing the most significant PSW features. It can be
      conceptually divided in four stages, each described in the
      following subsections. Customers in a winery use their
      smartphones to discover bottles equipped with PW/PSW beacons.
      In each stage the user exploits progressively even more
      advanced functions, including the simulation of variations in
      environmental parameters (conditioning the discovery). For
      the purposes of demonstrating the app, a PSW-compatible
      Android smartphone<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
      "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> is used. Bottles are equipped
      with two standard PW beacons like the Bluvision BEEKs
      Lite<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id="foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a>
      shown in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>(A) and
      three PSW beacons (two PSW-URL and one PSW-UID), represented
      by two <em>Intel Edison</em><a class="fn" href="#fn5" id=
      "foot-fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> boards like in Figure <a class=
      "fig" href="#fig1">1</a>(B) and a <em>Raspberry Pi 3 Model
      B</em><a class="fn" href="#fn6" id=
      "foot-fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> like in Figure <a class="fig"
      href="#fig1">1</a>(C). Generic Wi-Fi Internet connectivity
      and energy supply are the only requirements for the demo
      environment; a monitor can be used to replicate the
      smartphone screen for greater visibility and convenience.</p>

        <p><em>Francesco is organizing an elegant dinner party. He
        enters a winery looking for a fine bottle.</em> After
        activating Bluetooth on his smartphone, he starts the
        <em>Find My Wine!</em> Android application to discover the
        exposed beacon advertisements. Detected ads are listed in a
        result screen, as shown in Figure 2(a) . At this stage,
        only two Physical Web beacons are visible in the cellar.
        They expose URLs to the specific wine Web pages and are
        ordered according to the physical distance from the user
        (estimated by comparing received signal strength and
        <em>transmitted power</em> field in Eddystone frames).</p>
        <p>For each beacon, the app can retrieve some basic
        metadata (<em>e.g.</em>, title/description as in Figure
        2(b)) or open the advertised Web page in the browser. All
        beacon information is retrieved by resolving the advertised

        <p>The user can enable the <em>Physical Semantic Web</em>
        option from the settings screen in Figure 4(a) to perform a
        more accurate and flexible resource discovery<a class="fn"
        href="#fn8" id="foot-fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>. In addition to
        previously discovered wines, three PSW beacons
        (specifically, two PSW-URL and one PSW-UID) are advertised
        now through Intel Edison or Raspberry Pi 3 boards running
        the <em>PSW-toolkit</em> framework<a class="fn" href="#fn9"
        id="foot-fn9"><sup>9</sup></a>. Each PSW-URL beacon exposes
        a URL used to download a Web Ontology Language [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]
        annotation from the Web (Figure 3(a)), whereas the PSW-UID
        beacon advertises an OWL annotation stored on the beacon
        itself. In the last case, as shown in Figure 3(b), the user
        device retrieves the resource description through a
        peer-to-peer connection (<em>e.g.</em>, Bluetooth)
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>].</p>
        <p>User's mobile device embeds a semantic matchmaking
        engine [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]
        allowing to rank retrieved annotations in relevance order
        w.r.t. a request. Requests can be either built implicitly
        –by means of context-aware profiler daemons running on the
        device– or explicitly, through <em>e.g.</em>, a graphical
        or speech-based user interface. The demo app provides a
        graphical editor of OWL requests to: i) navigate the
        reference taxonomy describing main wine features
        (<em>e.g.</em>, wine colors in Figure 4(b)); ii) show both
        class and object property hierarchy; iii) compose a request
        selecting basic OWL ontology elements. For the purposes of
        the demo, a simple reference ontology has been created,
        inspired by classical examples in [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. OWL annotations of
        bottles contain both a description of the wine and
        conservation status information. Beacons are ranked w.r.t.
        the user request by means of a semantic-based utility

        "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. The adopted semantic matchmaking
        relies on non-standard inference services in Description
        Logics. Whenever the request is incompatible with an
        object's annotation (<em>i.e.</em>, &nbsp; their
        conjunction is unsatisfiable), <em>Concept Contraction</em>
        determines what part of the request cause the
        incompatibility and therefore should be retracted to pursue
        a match. If user's request and object's annotation are
        compatible, but the latter does not contain all requested
        features, <em>Concept Abduction</em> identifies the request
        elements not explicitly covered and therefore to be
        hypothesized about the object (under Open World Assumption)
        to reach a full match. As detailed in [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>], <em>penalty
        functions</em> are associated to the outcome of Concept
        Contraction and Abduction –since minimal retraction and
        hypothesis are preferred– and provide a semantic distance
        metric of a set of objects w.r.t. a given request, enabling
        a logic-based relevance ranking. In the app settings,
        several weight configurations are available to combine the
        semantic distance with context-aware data-oriented
        attributes (<em>i.e.</em>, physical distance and user's
        preference) in the general penalty formula described in
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>].</p>
        <p>In case of trivial syntactic matching, all beacons would
        have the same score. A semantic-based matchmaking and a
        proper modelling of the reference knowledge base, make
        possible instead to highlight discrepancies between
        descriptions. By selecting a beacon, the user can: i) open
        in the browser the related Web page; ii) only for PSW
        devices, show the exposed OWL annotation (as in Figure
        4(d)) and likewise the matchmaking outcome explanation. In
        the last case, the user can navigate missing and
        incompatible features between the bottle annotation and the
        user request. In Figure 4(c), <em>Mountadam Pinot Noir</em>
        obtains the highest rank because it covers all features
        specified by the user. <em>Chateau Morgon Beaujolais</em>
        and <em>Forman Cabernet Sauvignon</em> obtain a lower score
        because they cover the request partially and also contain
        inappropriate features.</p>

        <p>PSW supports OWL annotations exposed by (both PSW-URL
        and PSW-UID) beacons changing dynamically due to
        events/phenomena occurring to objects and/or context. In
        the proposed demo, the quality of each wine bottle can
        change according to storage conditions during its lifetime.
        An Arduino <em>TinkerKit Sensor Shield</em> is connected to
        one of the Intel Edison boards to emulate variations of
        environmental conditions in the winery, such as
        temperature, humidity and luminosity. Acting on the
        attached potentiometer, it is possible to simulate the
        situation of <em>e.g.</em>, a bottle left for some hours in
        a place with a very low temperature, very high humidity and
        high luminosity. Due to this reason, the wine quality
        decreases and the related annotation is updated. When a new
        discovery round starts, degradation of the wine is
        detected, leading to a final rank lower than before: see in
        Figure 5(a) the case of modifications on <em>Mountadam
        Pinot Noir</em>.</p>
        <p>A <em>history</em> list keeps already explored objects
        when the user opens URLs or displays OWL annotations.
        Moreover, the user can mark one or more beacons as
        <em>favorites</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, useful, as in Figure
        5(b)) or <em>spam</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, useless or
        unwanted): in the following discovery procedures the rank
        of such beacons will be respectively increased or
        decreased.</p>

        required to retrieve data from the Web. In the PSW,
        exploiting Eddystone-UID frames, knowledge exchange can
        also occur through point-to-point connectivity. The
        proposed app demonstrates that all PSW features are
        available even when Wi-Fi and cellular data networks are
        switched off on the smartphone. Furthermore, since in IoT
        scenarios connectivity is often intermittent, PSW allows
        caching OWL annotations retrieved from detected objects for
        a limited time.</p>

      <p>The proposed demo provides interactive examples of the
      benefits of the Physical Semantic Web over the basic Physical
      Web framework. It is conceived as a four-stage journey, to
      engage users with various level of expertise and knowledge on
      the specific technologies involved. The reference scenario
      has been chosen to be easy to understand.</p>
      <p>The first stage is dedicated to the current Physical Web
      paradigm. By trying out the basic PW discovery features, even
      users with no prior working knowledge of PW solutions can
      familiarize with the benefits of the general PW proposal as
      well as with its limits. The second stage introduces the PSW
      framework and allows an interactive first-hand experience of
      the enhancements to the overall capabilities. In particular,
      users should be able to appreciate the benefits of
      fine-grained matchmaking enabled by accurate semantic-based
      object annotation. The third stage demonstrates advanced
      features, such as favorite and spam caching, as well as the
      PSW ability to deal with dynamic annotations. In this case,
      users are able to set input data directly, by adjusting
      potentiometers attached to the demo PSW beacon.</p>
      <p>Finally, the fourth and last demo stage shows how the PSW
      grants interaction even when a network infrastructure is
      unavailable, by exploiting point-to-point data exchanges
      only. This may appear as a corner case in the reference demo
      scenario, although most wineries are actually located in
      cellars without cellular or wireless local area network
      connectivity. Most importantly, however, that kind of
      situations is frequent in challenging IoT application
      scenarios (<em>e.g.</em>, environmental monitoring,
      surveillance, robot search and rescue teams, <em>etc.</em>),
      where stable Web connectivity cannot be granted. In those
      cases, basic interactions based on data retrieved from remote
      web services (<em>e.g.</em>, through simple URLs associated
      to beacons or barcodes) result unusable. The PSW still
      supports full capabilities, so enabling a whole new range of
      thing-to-thing cooperation scenarios through on-board
      autonomous software agents in addition to user-to-thing
      interactions.</p>
