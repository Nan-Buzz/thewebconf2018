In this regard, starting from an anonymized dataset of <em>Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)</em> data from the largest telecommunications operator in Chile, we focus on the following questions: <em>What</em> are the most popular applications used in the city? <em>Where</em> are they spatially clustered? <em>When</em> does an application is more frequently used? And <em>How</em> does the urban context and the mobility patterns relate to application usage? As a result, we observed that specific applications present high spatial clustering, while the most popular services are geographically dispersed throughout the entire city. Clusters appear in places of high floating population; however, hotspots vary in space depending on the application. Interestingly, we found that commuting plays an important role, both in terms of rush hours and transportation infrastructure.

The availability of geolocated digital traces has enabled areas such as urban informatics and computational geography. While the aforementioned areas rely on geolocated data, they are generally not focused on a critical aspect of humans: they are dynamic multi-tasking agents whose needs constantly evolve during a day. This means, for example, that mobility patterns and informational needs are coupled with what they are doing and where. The city is experienced in sequence, and these sequences are unique for each person [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. As such, there is the need to understand whether there is a relationship between activities performed and the urban context surrounding a user, <em>i.e.</em>, which applications a user is running, and the physical context where these activities take place in a city, such as the metro while commuting, the workplace, a recreational area, or the private home.</p>    <p>There is work done in this area that involves different approaches: mobile phones with custom logging applications; in-situ studies, and server logs analyses. However, they tend not to focus on the influence that the daily urban life has on the digital sphere. In this paper, we present a descriptive analysis of a large scale longitudinal dataset of mobile applications usage in Santiago, Chile, from the largest telecommunications operator in the country. The digital traces, anonymized, filtered and aggregated at cellular tower level to protect customer privacy, allow us to study spatial and temporal patterns according to different facets: the (i) <em>what</em>, or which applications are most accessed; (ii) <em>where</em>, or the places that are more associated with an app; (iii) <em>when</em>, or the times of the day where an app is more prevalent; and (iv) <em>how</em>, which we interpret as the physical context in which a mobile service is mainly used. In particular, we focus our analysis on the effect of commuting and the mode of transportation. In fact, commuting changes the surrounding and attentional context of users and thus plays an important role in modeling users behavior.</p>    <p>Our contributions can be summarized as follows:</p>    <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list1" label="&#x2022;">We map IP addresses to mobile applications identifying the most popular services accessed via a mobile device in Santiago.<br/></li>     <li id="list2" label="&#x2022;">We apply spatial analysis tools to find application-specific traffic <em>hot spots</em> by estimating spatial auto-correlation metrics.<br/></li>     <li id="list3" label="&#x2022;">We perform a regression analysis with generalized linear models at different time intervals to model usage patterns. As input for the regression, we label cellular towers according to contextual urban features, <em>e.g.</em>, point of interests. We show that some popular applications are dispersed across the city (more than expected by a random null model), while other applications present spatial clustering, which we analyze from a global and local perspective. Clusters appear in places of high floating population, but not in the same places for all applications.<br/></li>     <li id="list4" label="&#x2022;">We show in what extent commuting plays an important role in application usage, both in terms of time (rush hours) and transportation infrastructure (metro stations, highways, bus corridors).<br/></li>    </ul>    <p>Finally, we present a discussion on these results, which shed light on what is possible to infer from anonymized and aggregated digital traces. This includes surfacing the spatial and temporal habits of passive users, <em>i.e.</em>, those that use applications but do not publish content; and how the relationship of usage trends with commuting empowers users in one of the most widespread daily activities.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-7">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> Methods and Datasets</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>In this section we present the methods and the datasets we adopt for the descriptive analysis.</p>    <section id="sec-8">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.1</span> What: Application Labeling</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>The primary input of this analysis is the log of accesses to specific IP addresses per mobile phone tower. Consequently, the first step of the methodology is to map each IP address to an application label. The application labels include specific applications (<em>e.g.</em>, WhatsApp, Facebook, or Twitter) as well as general categories (<em>e.g.</em>, Games, or Email Client). In the rest of the paper, we refer to both as applications, apps, or categories.</p>     <p>Given an IP address, we perform a WHOIS<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> query, and we decide on a label depending on the output of the call. Three cases are possible:</p>     <ol class="list-no-style">     <li id="list5" label="(1)">The owner of the IP address is identified as a specific service. In this case, we label the corresponding address with the name of the owner. Well known apps were discovered in this case (<em>e.g.</em>, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify), along with local websites, newspapers, radio and television services.<br/></li>     <li id="list6" label="(2)">The owner of the IP address is a company that makes more than one app (<em>e.g.</em>, Apple, Microsoft, or game companies). In this case, we use a reverse DNS lookup service<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> that returns the current and previous hostnames that points (or pointed) to the IP address. Here we hypothesize that the hostname reveals the name of the application. For instance, an IP address associated with the hostname in the form <a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://xxx.yyy.com">xxx.yyy.com</a> is related to the mobile application <em>xxx</em> (or, in some scenarios, <em>yyy</em>). With this approach we were able to identify applications such as Skype, WhatsApp, Apple Maps, and Google Maps.<br/></li>     <li id="list7" label="(3)">The IP address is hosted in a cloud service. In this case, we query directories of IP addresses generally accessed by Android applications. Such directories has been compiled to study privacy and geographical data breaches. One example is the PDTLoc<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> repository created by Eskandari <em>et al.</em>&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. In this case, applications related with dating and car transportation were identified due to their dependency on external mapping services.<br/></li>     </ol>     <p>We filter out the IPs that fall in more than one case.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-9">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.2</span> Where: Spatial Autocorrelation</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>We seek to understand whether the urban context, <em>i.e.</em>, the built environment and the functional areas of a city, influences application usage. This involves testing whether application usage tends to cluster in the spatial arrangement of towers. For instance, one would expect that photo-sharing applications are mostly used in proximity to towers within a touristic area. Since the boundaries of such areas are not known (as they may not be officially defined), one way to find photographed areas of the city, rather than specific points of interests, is through the identification of <em>Hot Spots</em>. A spatial cluster, or <em>Hot Spot</em>, is a region where the application usage is concentrated, with more accesses per tower than its surroundings. As example, if a tower <em>i</em> has a massive amount of accesses, but its neighbor towers do not exhibit similar behavior, then tower <em>i</em> does not lie within a <em>Hot Spot</em>. One way of measuring this is through global and local spatial auto-correlation.</p>     <p>In spatial analysis, there are several spatial auto-correlation metrics that capture this behavior. Here we use the Getis-Ord family of metrics&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>], <em>G</em> (global) and <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$G_i^*$</span>     </span> (local), which have been used in contexts such as traffic incidents [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>] and crime-detection with social media [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. The global <em>G</em> metric is defined as: <div class="table-responsive">      <div class="display-equation">       <span class="tex mytex">\[ G = \frac{\sum _{i=1}^n \sum _{j=1}^n w_{ij}(d) x_i x_j}{\sum _{i=1}^n \sum _{j=1}^n x_i x_j}, j \ne i, \] </span>       <br/>      </div>     </div> where <em>w<sub>ij</sub>     </em>(<em>d</em>) is a quadratic distance decay function between towers <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> (by definition, this weight is symmetric); <em>x<sub>j</sub>     </em> is the total number of accesses to the application under study at tower <em>j</em>. This metric can be standardized, and thus, a value of <em>z</em>(<em>G</em>)>&#x00A0;1.96 (which, in a normal distribution, represents the 97.5% percentile point) indicates that app traffic tends to cluster spatially, in comparison with a null model of random distribution; conversely, <em>z</em>(<em>G</em>) < &#x00A0;1.96 (2.5% percentile point) indicates that app traffic tends to be more dispersed than expected in a null model, with 95% of confidence. We expect that some applications do not have significant spatial clustering, due to their general usage patterns or their popularity.</p>     <p>For applications that have a significant <em>z</em>(<em>G</em>), we will estimate the local metric <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$G_{i}^{*}$</span>     </span>, defined as: <div class="table-responsive">      <div class="display-equation">       <span class="tex mytex">\[ G_{i}^{*} = \frac{\sum _{j=1}^{n} w_{ij}(d)x_j}{\sum _{j=1}^n x_j}. \] </span>       <br/>      </div>     </div> The formulation of <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$G_i^*$</span>     </span> measures the concentration of app usage at tower <em>i</em> and its surroundings. As its parent metric, <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$G_i^*$</span>     </span> can also be standardized, which allows to identify clusters of towers that have significantly more accesses by each application (with <em>z</em> > &#x00A0;1.96 with a confidence of 95%). Since the <em>z</em> score may be negative, this also includes clusters where app access is below than expected (<em>i.e.</em>, a <em>Cold Spot</em>). In this work, we focus only on <em>Hot Spots</em>.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-10">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.3</span> When and How: Temporal Behavior</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>In this section, we focus on (1) the temporal dynamics of the application usage signal and (2) its relation with urban indicators. For instance, two spatial clusters may be in different areas of the city, yet they may share characteristics, such as the socio-economic indicators, or the availability of types of points of interests. To evaluate this, we performed a series of generalized linear model (GLM) [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>] regressions over the set of IP accesses. Particularly, this model uses a Negative Binomial regression [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>], which is used for count data (<em>e.g.</em>, the number of accesses) in over-dispersed scenarios (<em>e.g.</em>, the variance is larger than the mean). In prior work, we used this method to measure the effect of Pok&#x00E9;mon Go in a city [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>], which we adapt here for application accesses:</p>     <p>The model is specified as follows: <div class="table-responsive">      <div class="display-equation">       <span class="tex mytex">\[ \log (E[X_a(b,t)]) = \log \alpha + \beta _0 + \sum \beta _i X_i \] </span>       <br/>      </div>     </div> where <em>E</em>[<em>X<sub>a</sub>     </em>(<em>b</em>, <em>t</em>)] is the expected number of connections to application <em>a</em> using a tower <em>b</em> at time-window <em>t</em>.

Moreover, the model exposure <em>&#x03B1;</em> represents the number of users connected to each tower, which allows to control for the fluctuations of population throughout the day.</p>     <p>By evaluating this model at every time-window available, it is possible to study the variation of the application usage during a day (<em>&#x03B2;</em>     <sub>0</sub>), as well as the effect of the covariates. To interpret the results, we visualize how the Odds-Ratio (OR) of a covariate (exp&#x2009;<em>&#x03B2;<sub>i</sub>     </em>) evolves during the day. The OR is interpreted as the fraction of change in the observed variable. An OR of 1 implies no significant effect; an OR&#x00A0; > 1 implies a positive change (<em>e.g.</em>, OR&#x00A0; = 1.5 means 50% increase), given all other factors remain equal.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-11">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.4</span> Datasets</h3>     </div>     </header>     <figure id="fig1">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191561/images/www18companion-300-fig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 1"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Choropleth map of the municipalities within Santiago, Chile.

Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> displays the municipalities within the urban area of Santiago, according to their average yearly income.</p>     <p>To describe how the urban context is related with application usage, we work with an aggregated Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) dataset from Telefonica Chile, the biggest telco in the country, with a market share of 33% in 2016. DPI is a family of probe methods for network data, that, given a network package, identifies several of its properties, such as requested IP address and port. In particular, our dataset comes from the aggregation of DPI in the HUAWEI SmartCare SEQ Analyst and NetProbe tools [14], which is aimed at improving quality of service in mobile phone networks. Specifically, the NetProbe tool performs aggregation of multiple TCP flows, multiple HTTP transactions, email transactions or streaming buffers within a single record, identifying the initial and final timestamp of the application usage.</p>     <p>The dataset contains the number of connections to the top 5,000 IP addresses accessed by devices with a Telefonica SIM card with a data plan, between the July 27th, 2016, to the August 10th, 2016. Each row of the dataset contains the following information: <tt>tower id</tt>, <tt>date</tt>, <tt>time window</tt>, <tt>IP:port</tt>, <tt>number of accesses</tt>. The 5,000 limit represents around 80% of the most accessed IPs. The number of connections is sampled in time windows of 10 minutes at each tower in the urban area of the city. These thresholds were determined to impede analysis of tower and IP pairs which would enable user identification (<em>e.g.</em>, access to private servers). <figure id="fig2">      <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191561/images/www18companion-300-fig2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 2"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Schematic maps of Santiago.

Table shows the results. In addition to mobile apps, we categorized browser usage to specific content as a category. In the case of news, since we are interested in understanding news consumption instead of profiling access to specific outlets, we assigned them to the broader News category.

One can see that different patterns emerge from the distributions of their daily traffic. For instance, music applications seem to be strongly related with commuting, due to the location of their traffic peaks. Another pattern that can be seen is the steadily increase in traffic during the day for some categories, meaning that people play games, flirt (Dating) and watch videos mostly at the evening, when back at home from work (or study). Messaging and mail present a bell-shaped distribution, which account for their usage within work/study environments and when far away from family and friends. As such, these results support our hypothesis that application usage heavily differs within a day. We have left to see if such use differs also in the spatial and temporal contexts related to the urban built environment.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-14">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">3.2</span> Global Autocorrelation and Hot Spots</h3>     </div>     </header>     <figure id="fig4">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191561/images/www18companion-300-fig4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 4"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 4:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Point plots of the std. global Getis-Ord spatial autocorrelation <em>G</em> for each application, at business days (morning, afternoon and night) and weekend afternoon.

In these periods, we considered the cumulative traffic volume per tower/app pairs. Since we do not have all tower traffic, due to our focus on specific apps, and the limit of 5,000 IPs, we estimate the relative portion of traffic between the apps under study per tower. As distance band for the spatial autocorrelation, we defined a threshold of 1 Kilometer with quadratic decay. Then, we estimated <em>G</em> and <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$G_i^*$</span>     </span> for all towers, except those in underground metro-stations, as they may be near other towers, but metro passengers are in a different context than people outside (note that we considered those towers in the temporal analysis).</p>     <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> shows the global correlation metric <em>G</em> using point-plots. One can see that there are dispersed apps in the city (<em>z</em>(<em>G</em>) < &#x00A0;-1.96). This dispersed behavior occurs when high values repel other high values, and tend to be near low values, while clustered behavior occurs when high values cluster near other high values; or low values cluster near other low values. Note that Facebook and Video are always dispersed, while Maps are dispersed in only one time-window (business day afternoons). Null behavior, <em>i.e.</em>, apps without autocorrelation (|<em>z</em>(<em>g</em>)| < &#x00A0;1.96), also appear on the Figure. No autocorrelation implies neighbors values are random. Some applications present this behavior except in a specific time window: Messaging (<em>z</em>(<em>G</em>) > &#x00A0;1.96 in business day mornings), Games and Taxi (both <em>z</em>(<em>G</em>) > &#x00A0;1.96 in business day afternoons). The remaining apps present a majority (or all) of spatial autocorrelated time-windows. <figure id="fig5">      <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191561/images/www18companion-300-fig5.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 5"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 5:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Dot maps of Santiago.

Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a> shows the detected <em>Hot Spots</em> for all applications. It&#x0027;s worth noting that several apps present spatial clusters in similar locations, due to the high density of floating population in those areas (refer to Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> for a mapping of the phone towers). As expected, some widespread applications present <em>Hot Spots</em> geographically distributed across the entire city: e.g., Mail, News, Twitter, VideoCall, Instagram, and Music. The category Games follows the same behavior with a less dense spatial pattern. On the contrary, other categories are densely clustered in specific areas, where their use is more prevalent. These include Messaging and Dating (areas with a high concentration of business and commerce), or Taxi (business districts in high income areas, and places with loaded public transportation). Wikipedia does not seem to show a direct interpretable pattern. An interesting result that comes from the inspection of the <em>Hot Spots</em> distribution, is that, while spatial clusters tend to appear in areas of high floating population, they are not the same for all applications. For instance, News cover a wider area than the rest.</p>     <p>In addition, Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a> shows how the <em>Hot Spots</em> vary during the day, with some being significant for specific time-windows only. For instance, Messaging apps register hot spots mainly in the mornings, on the contrary, Dating cover several time-windows, as illustrated in the circular-like set of towers in downtown and near an area with the biggest shopping center in the city.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-15">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">3.3</span> Regression Results</h3>     </div>     </header>     <figure id="fig6">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191561/images/www18companion-300-fig6.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 6"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 6:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Matrix of time-series of the Odds-Ratio (effect size) of each factor under analysis, per application.

This allowed to modulate the application traffic in each tower according to the lower bound of people connected to it.</p>     <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a> shows a summary of the <em>&#x03B2;</em> coefficient for each application category. To simplify the exploration of the results, we applied a hierarchical clustering. The three clusters found are: (I) Music, Mail, Video, Games; (II) Instagram, Twitter, Wikipedia, VideoCall, Maps, Dating, Taxi; and (III) Messaging, Facebook, News. The time-series in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a> are colored according to the app clusters. However, a manual inspection of the charts did not reveal visually salient differences among them.</p>     <p>Conversely, the factor clusters analysis shows a clear semantic separation within them. The two clusters are: (A) <em>Is Weekend?</em>, <em>Near Secondary Streets</em>, <em>Near Primary Streets</em>, the <em>Intercept</em>, <em>Near Pedestrian Streets</em>; and (B) <em>Near Bus Corridor</em>, <em>Near Green Areas</em>, <em>Indoor</em>, <em>Income Decile</em>, <em>Near Highways</em>, <em>Within Metro</em>. On the one hand, cluster A refers to urban infrastructure from a city point of view (<em>e.g.</em>, &#x201C;this is a main street&#x201D;). On the other hand, Cluster B refers to kind of places and modes of transportation. Due to space constraints, here we summarize the main findings from these results, by focusing on some factors of each cluster.</p>     <p>In Cluster A: overall, the intercept captures the general patterns of application access (<em>c.f.</em> Fig. <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>), including Music, which follows a commuting-related distribution with peaks around labor hours. Weekend seems to have a similar behavior in all apps &#x2013; with the exception of Dating, which follows the opposite trend, and Taxi, which presents pulsating, yet significant, positive effects, mostly during the morning and afternoon. The street factors (Main Street, Secondary Street, Pedestrian) present mixed effects: some apps have positive effects on them while null or negative effects on the others, reflecting how people use streets (<em>e.g.</em>, Messaging has almost 10% more traffic in main streets, possibly because main streets have more people within them). Pedestrian streets have an overall null or negative relation with app traffic, except for Dating applications (<em>e.g.</em>, pedestrian streets contain good meeting points).</p>     <p>In Cluster B, the Metro factor shows distributions related to commuting hours. However, this behavior is not always symmetric. For instance, Music apps have 400% more traffic at the morning rush hour, while at the afternoon rush hour it is 300%. Highways usually have a higher association with applications, except with two that present larger amounts of text: Wikipedia and News (with those two categories the effect is null). We expected to see positive effects of Green Areas in apps like Instagram, but the opposite was found. In terms of Indoor contexts, the effect is usually negative, with exception at specific times of the day for Mail. Bus Corridors tend to have positive effects for all apps, except some null cases like Taxi, Dating, VideoCall and Wikipedia. One would have expected to behave in similar ways to the Metro factor, but bus riders may have a different profile than Metro&#x0027;s. Finally, the effects of area Income are small (at most 2% of traffic increase per increase in income decile), meaning that it does not show a powerful interaction though the urban context, probably due to the effect of floating population (which comes from different city areas).</p>    </section>   </section>   <section id="sec-16">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">4</span> Discussion</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>We performed a descriptive analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of application usage in the city. Some of these results are expected, due to our restriction to the most popular IP addresses, but others can be counter-intuitive, such as the small effect of area income or the lack of interesting effects of green area proximity. Even though application context is not a new topic, to the extent of our knowledge it has not been done at this scale, with the entire traffic of a major telco. for the most popular apps in a big city.</p>    <p>One interesting aspect is that many applications are scattered around the city (while still maintaining a degree of local clustering), yet they are perceived as applications with a biased user base. An example of such case is Twitter, where few users participate&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]. Following our results, Twitter may be biased in terms of who generates the content, but passive users may be less biased, as they are present in many areas of the city.</p>    <p>We observed that <em>Hot Spot</em> locations change during the day, and some factors vary their influence in app traffic. For application providers, this implies that information needs within the same application may vary depending on the context. An important context in which we put emphasis was commuting. Commuting is one of the most recurrent daily activities, and at the same time, it is the one least enjoyed [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. However, not all commuters suffer, some even say that &#x201C;getting there is half the fun&#x201D; [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. The notion of <em>equipped time</em> [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>] implies that, regardless of mode of transportation, commuters have several choices to make use of their time while traveling. While this has been studied in the past, the possibilities enabled by smartphones are yet to be explored&#x2013;something that our study shows through the factors related with commuting, and their mostly positive associations with app traffic. Given that commuting times are on the rise [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>], this is a relevant topic to study, with potential impact on user&#x0027;s lives.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-17">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">5</span> Related Work</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>The most common datasets from mobile phone networks are Extended and Call Detail Records (X/CDR), which have been studied extensively (see a survey [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]). Indeed, one of our auxiliary datasets is comprised by XDR data [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>].

We focused on the following aspects: <em>What</em> applications were used, among the most popular; <em>Where</em> and <em>When</em> those applications generated traffic; and <em>How</em> was the urban context surrounding users. The input was a dataset of Deep Packet Inspection from the biggest telco. in Chile, which, jointly with data from OpenStreetMap, allowed us to perform the analysis. We found that several applications present identifiable <em>Hot Spots</em> scattered around the city, and that the urban context, in terms of infrastructure, allows to understand the relationship between daily activities and application usage.</p>    <p>One limitation of our work is our focus on the most popular apps. There may be other apps, with a more fragmented user-base (<em>e.g.</em>, sport applications), that may still influence/be-influenced by the urban context, and that may show relevant differences in factors such as income. However, to solve this limitation, a strategy to aggregate data with the telco. should be defined, as a way to analyze more data without giving up privacy concerns. We hypothesize that if more apps were considered, the results could change incrementally, <em>i.e.</em>, the found patterns should remain. The extent of those patterns is left for future work.</p>    <p>Finally, an important aspect is privacy. We showed that, even though application traffic may be encrypted and aggregated, DPI data is able to reveal usage patterns on the city, even though these patterns present limits.</p>    <p>     <strong>Acknowledgements</strong>.
