          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The history of efforts to meet the demand for so-called
      ‘persistent identifiers’ (PIDs) for use on the Web is
      complicated, with many alternative offerings and much debate
      about the meaning of persistence and how to go about ensuring
      it. We take no position in that debate here, beyond the
      observation that the demand for PIDs shows no signs of
      abating, and that there has been a more-or-less general
      acknowledgement over the last 5–10 years that to be
      successful in the context of the Web a PID scheme must define
      and support a mapping from PIDs in the scheme to ‘actionable’
      identifiers. In practice this has meant specifying a purely
      syntactic procedure for converting a PID into an
      <tt>http(s):</tt> URI using a domain owned and operated by
      the proprietors of the scheme. An HTTP request for such
      ‘actionable’ URIs will typically result in a redirection to
      the then-current location of the identified resource.</p>
      <p>The Digital Object Identifier scheme [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>], managed by the
      International DOI Foundation (IDF) [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>], was an early adopter of
      this approach, and DOIs are now in widespread use,
      particularly in scientific journals, where their use is
      actually mandated by a number of major publishers. The
      mapping for DOIs to actionable <tt>https:</tt> URIs is
      simple: For example a DOI for a journal article written in
      the form of a URI such as <a class="link-inline force-break"
      href="http://doi:...">doi:...</a> is mapped (client-side) to
      <a class="link-inline force-break" href=
      "https://doi.org/...">https://doi.org/...</a><a class="fn"
      href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>1</sup></a>. In response to an
      HTTP request for that URI, the server at <tt>doi.org</tt>
      (operated on behalf of IDF by the Corporation for National
      Research Initiatives (CNRI) [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]) will respond with a redirect to the
      appropriate <tt>http(s):</tt> URI from the actual publisher
      of the article. We call the three forms involved the
      ’original’ (e.g. <tt>doi:</tt> or <tt>info:hdl</tt>), the
      ‘actionable’ (e.g. <tt>https://doi.org/...</tt> and variants
      thereof or <tt>http://hdl.handle.net/...</tt>) and the
      ‘locating’. Note that <em>none</em> of these is strictly
      speaking a PID as such: that's what comes <em>after</em> the
      <tt>doi:</tt> or <tt>https://hdl:handle.net/</tt>.</p>
      <p>The success of this approach has overcome a significant
      barrier to the adoption of PIDs in general: to date there has
      been no significant move towards support for any of them
      <em>as URIs</em> in web browsers or PDF viewers. That is, if
      you try to use <a class="link-inline force-break" href=
      "http://doi://10.1000/182">doi://10.1000/182</a> or <a class=
      "link-inline force-break" href=
      "http://info:hdl/20.1000/100">info:hdl/20.1000/100</a> as a
      link (for example, as the value of the <strong>href</strong>
      attribute of an HTML <strong>A</strong> element), it will not
      work. But you <em>can</em> use them as the link text of an
      <strong>A</strong> element, and put the actionable form
      (<a class="link-inline force-break" href=
      "https://doi.org/10.1000/182">https://doi.org/10.1000/182</a>
      and <a class="link-inline force-break" href=
      "http://hdl.handle.net/20.1000/100">http://hdl.handle.net/20.1000/100</a>
      respectively) in the <strong>href</strong> attribute, and
      <em>that</em> will work just fine.</p>
      <p>That's the good news. The less good news is that the use
      of redirection from the actionable form to the locating form
      means that when someone follows a link such as those in the
      previous paragraph, it's the <em>locating</em> form that
      appears in the address bar of their browser, and is thus the
      form they may well copy and paste into an email to a
      colleague or their own reading list. But this undermines the
      fundamental value proposition of the original (’persistent’)
      form: that it is not vulnerable to all the things that cause
      <tt>http:</tt> URIs to fail over time.</p>
      <p>Our goal in the work reported here was to quantify the
      growth over time in actual usage of the three forms, to see
      not only how good the good news was, but also whether there
      was cause to worry about the less good news: are locating
      forms ‘leaking’ into public use?</p>
      <p>For concrete evidence we used the Common Crawl sample of
      HTML pages on the Web [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>], the only large-scale public source
      of evidence readily available to us. This turned out to be
      challenging in a number of respects, to the extent that
      although our results are interesting, problems with the CC
      data mean that they may not accurately reflect the actual
      situation. In what follows we will first describe the work as
      such, and then discuss the ways in which the CC data fell
      short of what we think is required for reliable analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>Note on terminology</strong> Although most of the
      PIDs in various forms (original, actionable or locating)
      found during our studies were DOIs, we will be careful
      hereafter to use ‘PID’ when we mean <em>anything</em>
      recognised as a form of persistent identifier, and ‘DOI’ for
      the subset thereof which are some form of DOI.</p>

      <p>The only longitudinal study for PID usage we are aware of
      is [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]. They
      processed approximately 1.8 million scholarly articles
      published between 1997 and 2012, drawn from arXiv.org,
      Elsevier journals and PubMed Central, yielding a total of 2.2
      million URIs. Of these there were</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list4" label="•">397,412 actionable-form DOIs (all
        using <tt>dx.doi.org</tt>)<br /></li>
        <li id="list5" label="•">505,657
        ”should-be-DOIs”<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Their results are difficult to compare to ours, not only
      because they were looking at a disjoint set of years, but
      also because they didn't actually <em>look up</em> the
      actionable-form DOIs they found and then tabulate the
      occurrences of the resulting locating-form URIs. Instead they
      used ”a list of hash values of publisher [domain names]
      provided by CrossRef. If the hash of a [domain name] of an
      extracted reference matches a hash in CrossRef's list, a
      reference is [considered to be a should-be-DOI].” This was
      because their goal, as the name suggests, was to identify
      references that <em>could</em> have been DOIs, because the
      publisher was a CrossRef member and so would have assigned a
      DOI to the article in question. This is not quite the same
      goal as ours, which was to measure the ratio of
      actionable-form to locating-form PIDs <em>for the same
      individual article</em>.</p>

        <p>The difference between the ”URIs crawled” and ”Pages
        retrieved” columns in this table, particularly for 2014,
        signal a problem with the same URI being retrieved multiple
        times. Although the crawl always starts with a unique set
        of URIs and does not follow page-internal links, redirects
        to URIs in the initial set occur surprisingly often, giving
        rise to duplication in some cases. The ”Duplicate URI %age”
        column in Table&nbsp;reftab:t1 reports this, as
        <em>estimated</em> by subtracting the ratio of the URI to
        Page columns from 1. Detecting instances of this problem
        and not including pages from the duplicates has improved
        considerably between 2014 and 2017, as can be seen from the
        convergence of the ”URIs crawled” and ”Pages retrieved”
        columns and the big drop in the duplicate URI percentage
        estimate.</p>
        <p>This duplication does not always mean that duplicate
        pages have been retrieved – as the crawl takes several
        weeks to complete the identified page may have changed. A
        direct estimate of the number of duplicate pages retrieved,
        based on comparing Hyperloglog digest values, is shown in
        Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a>. We'll return
        to the impact this has on our DOI tabulations in the
        Results section below.</p>

        <p>For the first study we wanted to check every link from
        the body of each crawled HTML page, which meant downloading
        around 110,000 WAT-format files totalling around 36TB in
        (compressed) size.</p>
        <p>We achieved this by streaming about 1/10th of the data
        each night, divided over approximately 100 machines that
        were detected as idle in one of several student labs. Each
        machine tabulated summary counts for approximately 100 WAT
        files each night, taking 4–6 hours. These were uploaded to
        a central machine and merged. The process was slightly
        different in 2014 and 2017: only in 2017 did we look for
        PIDs in their locating form, as explained below.</p>
        <section id="sec-10">
          <p><em>4.1.1 2014 crawl.</em> There were 44488 WAT files
          to be processed, containing information from a total of
          2,534,229,771 pages. For each page the WAT file contains
          three JSON objects, one each for information about the
          crawl, the HTTP request and the HTTP response. We
          extracted the latter, and from it the following three

          appeared in the crawled URI set)</p>

          frequency tabulations, we have both type and token
          frequency.</p>

        <section id="sec-11">
          <p><em>4.1.2 2017 crawl.</em> For the April 2017 crawl,
          we added two additional tabulations:</p>
          <ul class="list-no-style">
            <li id="list24" label="•">Document frequency for
            actionable URIs, that is, the number of pages in which
            each appears, regardless of how many times<br /></li>

            which is the locating form of an actionable URI in the
            2014 Link set, type, token and document
            frequency<br /></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The latter counts were tabulated by taking all the
          2014 actionable forms, issuing HTTP HEAD requests for
          them and noting the Location response header which came
          back (iterating and accumulating until a 200 response was
          achieved). This succeeded more that 99% of the time, and
          a Bloom filter was constructed from the results, which
          then allowed us to check every Link URI as we processed
          the 2017 Link URIs.</p>
          <p>These counts are restricted to the 2017 appearances of
          the locating forms of 2014 actionable forms, because we
          didn't have time to do two passes over either the 2014
          data or the 2017 data.</p>
          <p>For both years, the final step was to extract the PID
          itself (that is, the path part of the actionable-form
          URI, regardless of URI scheme, redirection server
          hostname or query parameters) and merge the counts across
          all the actionable-form URIs with the same PID. Unless
          otherwise noted, these are the counts reported in the
          Results section below.</p>

        data to be processed in about 6 hours, an improvement of
        about a factor of 8 over the first study.</p>
        <p>As in the first study, only the ‘response’ JSON object
        was processed, extracting 3 components:</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list26" label="•">
          <tt>Envelope/Payload-Metadata/HTTP-Response-Metadata/HTML-Metadata/Links</tt>
          (as in study 1)<br /></li>
          <li id="list27" label="•">
          <tt>Envelope/Payload-Metadata/HTTP-Response-Metadata/HTML-Metadata/Head/Link</tt>
          (an array)<br /></li>
          <li id="list28" label="•">
          <tt>Envelope/Payload-Metadata/HTTP-Response-Metadata/HTML-Metadata/Head/Metas</tt>
          (an array)<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each member of the Metas array is an object, where the
        ones of interest had the following contents:</p>
        <p><img src=
        "http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191636/images/www18companion-375-img3.svg"
        class="img-responsive" alt="" longdesc="" /></p>
        <p>and we counted objects where the ”content” property was
        an original-form DOI.</p>
        <p>Likewise for the Link array, where we care about</p>
        <p><img src=
        "http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191636/images/www18companion-375-img4.svg"
        class="img-responsive" alt="" longdesc="" /></p>
        <p>and counted ones where the ”href” property was an
        original-form DOI.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the first study, all that was tabulated
        were occurrence counts per page of any original-form DOI,
        counts for the different DOIs themselves were not kept, so
        the net results were just three totals, first per WAT file,
        then after merging, per month.</p>
        <p>Finally a very small sample, just 645 WAT files from
        April 2014 (1.5% of the total), was processed looking only
        at the Metas array, to count the different values of ”name”
        whose ”content” was an original-form DOI.</p>

        <p>The overlap between the sets of URIs crawled in April
        2014 and April 2017 is low (estimated at 7%) and for the
        responses (pages) themselves even lower (estimated at 0.8%)
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] However
        the PID numbers have a much higher overlap: the union of
        the two years contains only 14.7 million PIDs – the details
        are given in Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab6">6</a>.
        This suggests that the overlap PIDs are <em>very</em>
        popular, as they are not just persisting from 2014 to 2017,
        but their second appearance is in a <em>different</em> set
        of pages.</p>

        2014, from which 5+ million distinct PIDs were extracted,
        almost all of which successfully yielded locating URIs. Of
        these around 400,000 (8%) by type count, or 1.2 million
        (10%) by token count, occurred in body links in the the
        2017 crawl. There is of course no way to tell whether these
        usages arose from the kind of leakage scenario discussed in
        the Introduction, or whether they were found and used
        independently of the antecedent actionable-form URI, but
        either way this is a large enough number to be of some
        concern.</p>

        <p>It's interesting to see that a small number of
        original-form <tt>doi:</tt> URIs are appearing as e.g.
        <strong>A/@href</strong>, and that this usage is slowly
        increasing. It's certainly not obvious <em>why</em> anyone
        would do this: It would be necessary to look at the
        complete HTML pages to make sense of this.</p>
        <p>The much more substantial use in HTML head
        <strong>meta</strong> elements is, on the other hand, quite
        plausible, although the drop in 2017 is hard to evaluate
        without seeing data from the surrounding months.</p>
        <p>We did a quick check of around 1.5% of the April 2014 to
        see which meta tags the doi: URIs were being used with.

      <p>The work reported here cannot be taken as anything more
      than a starting point, demonstrating that it is possible to
      extract longitudinal information about URI usage and
      encouraging others to do so: neither the numbers nor the
      trends presented here can be claimed to be reliable. It
      illustrates the kind of questions we would like to get
      answers for with respect to one kind of longitudinal study,
      and the very <em>lack</em> of reliable answers to those
      questions points towards the things we need to do to improve
      the situation.</p>
      <p>In what follows we look at a number of different kinds of
      problem we encountered and suggest possible remediations.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Duplication of pages crawled within an individual
        release is an issue for any use of Common Crawl data.
        Duplication of pages between releases may be a bug or a
        feature for longitudinal study, but its existence needs to
        be taken account of in any case.</p>
        <p>A number of discussions of these issues can be found in
        the Common Crawl forum [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>], and it does appear that
        within-release duplication has been considerably
        reduced.</p>
        <p>However, for our study, and as noted above in the
        Materials section, the April 2014 data shows a substantial
        degree of likely duplication at the page level. This is
        almost entirely due to two sources [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>]</p>
        <ol class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list35" label="(1)">Shared error
          pages;<br /></li>
          <li id="list36" label="(2)">Same page for distinct URIs
          differing only in query parameter values.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>It seems reasonable to assume that error pages are
        unlikely to involve much PID use, and the same is true for
        the kinds of commercially-orientated applications which
        make heavy use of query parameters. The latter expectation
        is easy to check empirically, and a quick check of a random
        sample (3425 actionable-form (a mixture of doi.org and
        dx.doi.org) URIs from 4 different WAT files from April
        2014) confirms this: none of them have query
        parameters.</p>
        <p>There's clearly a pressing need for a careful study of
        the last 3 or 4 years of CC data, to establish in detail
        the within- and between-release overlaps, both with respect
        to content and URI (see also section&nbsp;<a class="sec"
        href="#sec-19">6.2</a>). CC's own version of this
        information [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] covers 2015 onwards, but has not as
        far as we know been published in a peer-reviewed context or
        otherwise confirmed.</p>
        <p>In harvesting URIs from the Links component of the
        response records in a CC WAT file, we encountered a wide
        range of low-level problems with format and character
        encoding. Some of these did <em>not</em> occur in the
        original, in the few cases we checked by hand and could
        find. Although tedious, a survey of the kinds of errors
        introduced in the WAT files is needed, to at least document
        their frequency over time, but also to try to establish
        which can be detected reliably and, of those detectable,
        which can be reliably corrected. For those problems which
        persist in more recent releases, we would hope once alerted
        to them CC could fix the problem at source going
        forward.</p>
        <p>Correct reporting of links that are found is important,
        but so is actually reliably <em>detecting</em> links—some
        empirical checking of this would also be a good idea.</p>
        <p>The recent rapid growth of personalised responses based
        on information in the query string of URIs and/or on
        cookies has serious implications for the ’Identifier’
        aspect of URIs, and the extent to which responses to URIs
        which share their <tt>authority</tt> and <tt>path</tt>
        components but not their <tt>query</tt>. Again, at least
        some comparison of CC crawl target URIs both with and
        without including the <tt>query</tt> component is
        needed.</p>
        <p>For the two CC releases we have checked, that is April
        2014 and April 2017, the good news is that the percentage
        of HTTP vs. HTTPS is close as between URIs crawled and Link
        URIs seen (around 20 to 1 in 2014, dropping to 3.3 to 1 in
        2017, reflecting the success of initiatives such as Encrypt
        the Web [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>]. A more systematic tabulation over
        all releases is obviously needed before we can tell whether
        this is a reliable trend or not. How representative a
        sample the CC HTML is of Web HTML as a whole is unknown,
        and indeed it's not clear how one would quantify this.</p>
        <p>A <em>much</em> more serious coverage issue,
        particularly for the persistence issues we started out to
        explore, is the lack of anything other than HTML documents
        in the CC releases. For scholarly publications, which are a
        major market for PIDs, PDF is the preferred format for
        publication. Expanding CC to include PDF files clearly
        would be a major undertaking, but at least some attempt to
        crawl links from a CC release to PDF files would be useful
        to get some sense of how much the profile of links found
        <em>there</em> differs from that in the HTML data.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Detecting and at least tabulating, preferably
        eliminating, exact duplicate content is of course
        important, but for at least some kinds of longitudinal
        studies, detecting and relating multiple versions of the
        ’same’ content is also important. Detecting
        similar-but-different content retrieved from different
        (post-redirection) URIs is obviously non-trivial, as it
        depends implicitly on some notion of ’sufficient’
        similarity to count as the same version. Plagiarism
        detection software has a contribution to make here. Even
        quite a tight threshold might be very useful: in a way two
        documents which differ only by a tiny change, say a single
        spelling correction, is much worse than two identical
        document, because hash-based methods will find the latter
        but not the former.</p>

        </header>
        <p>At the very least the variability and occasional
        unreliability of the Common Crawl data means that for
        improved confidence the usage being studied should be
        tabulated for <em>every</em> month's crawl over a at least
        a year. With hindsight it would also probably be wise to
        use crawls from 2015 onwards, as both the effort to remove
        duplicates and the documentation improve noticeably at that
        point. This in turn however begins to move the effort
        involved out of the reach of the kind of <em>ad-hoc</em>
        multiprocessor we assembled and used for the first study.
        Even the 6-hour turnaround we achieved for the second study
        still made debugging a tedious and potentially expensive
        process. We have some speed-ups in mind, but they are
        unlikely to gain us more than a factor of two or so.
        Generosity of the sort provided by the donor of cloud
        resources for the second study will be needed if academic
        longitudinal studies of Web usage are to reach the levels
        of reliability and utility we need.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, Common Crawl releases since 2015 provide
        a potential basis for longitudinal studies of HTML web page
        content and linking, but results have to be treated with
        caution. A number of gaps in documentation and quality
        assurance need to be addressed before conclusions based on
        such studies can be taken as reliable.</p>

      question by Greg Janée at PHOIBOS 2 [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]: “How effective are
      PIDs?”. He subsequently expanded on this: “A PID is
      <em>effective</em> only if the resource identified by the PID
      is uniformly and universally accessed via the PID, and not
      via other non-persistent URLs” [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
