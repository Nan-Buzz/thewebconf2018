        <p><small>The DARPA Memex program was established with the
        goal of funding research into building domain-specific
        search systems that integrated state-of-the-art focused
        crawling (‘domain discovery’) information extraction and
        semantic search, and that could be used by users and domain
        experts with no programming or technical experience.
        Domain-specific Insight Graphs (DIG) was proposed and
        funded under Memex and has led to an end-to-end search
        system currently being used by over 200 law enforcement for
        combating human trafficking, by investigators from the
        Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US for
        investigating securities fraud, and for numerous other
        domains of a difficult, socially consequential (e.g.,
        investigative) and unusual nature.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Web search today uses a centralized approach that searches
      the Internet with a one-size-fits-all set of tools for all
      queries. Despite its extensive commercial success, it does
      not work well for many use cases, especially in government,
      defense and also social systems. For example, Web search
      today still remains a largely manual process that does not
      save sessions, requires nearly exact input with one-at-a-time
      entry, and doesn't organize or aggregate results beyond a
      list of links. Moreover, common search practices miss
      information in the Deep Web (the parts of the web not indexed
      by standard commercial search engines), and ignore shared
      content across pages.</p>
      <p>The DARPA Memex program was launched with the goal of
      advancing online search capabilities far beyond the current
      state of the art. The goal is to invent better methods for
      interacting with and sharing information, so users can
      quickly and thoroughly organize and search subsets of
      information relevant to their individual interests. The
      technologies developed in the program would provide the
      mechanisms for improved content discovery, information
      extraction, information retrieval, user collaboration and
      other key search functions.</p>
      <p>One of the projects funded under the Memex program is the
      Domain-specific Insight Graph (DIG) project, led by the USC
      Information Sciences Institute. To address the challenges
      posed by Memex, DIG uses a <em>knowledge graph</em>-centric
      approach. In recent years, knowledge graphs have emerged as
      powerful platforms both in search and the general Artificial
      Intelligence community (especially, Semantic Web and Natural
      Language Processing). DIG advances the state-of-the-art both
      in using and in representing knowledge graphs for search and
      analytics. Over three years of research, DIG has emerged as a
      single extensible ecosystem that addresses many of the
      challenges of Memex, and is now widely in use by many
      real-world agencies for fighting problems such as human
      trafficking with the use of technology (Section <a class=
      "sec" href="#sec-4">2</a>). DIG can be set up and used by
      people with no programming abilities, an important strength
      in an era when systems continue to become ever more complex
      and opaque. DIG is available on GitHub as an open-source
      project<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=

      addition to the formal collaborations listed in the table,
      informal collaborations with other teams funded under Memex
      were also routinely undertaken over the life of the program.
      For example, the Ache crawler, developed by a research team
      from New York University, is included in the DIG ecosystem
      for those who want to truly start from scratch i.e. data
      collection.</p>

      <p>Research funded under Memex, including not only DIG but
      outputs by other performers, has resulted in democratization
      of search technology, since it allows users with no
      programming experience to build domain-specific search
      engines that would normally take significant technical
      expertise. Users can set up their own information extractors,
      search engines, focused crawlers, and even customized UIs,
      all under a unified framework. The software is open-source
      and has been used to set up the first search engine that is
      being actively used by law enforcement and other
      resource-strapped agencies whose funding is constantly under
      pressure. In the human trafficking domain, Memex tools have
      resulted in recent prosecutions in the US and are being
      transitioned permanently to state district attorneys. DIG has
      also yielded significant research output over the last three
      years, in addition to research outreach in the form of
      tutorials, talks and demonstrations at both top-tier academic
      conferences and industrial venues.</p>

        "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. More broadly, our experience has
        spurred us to write a graduate-level textbook on knowledge
        graphs, which will be published by MIT Press later this
        year. DIG has supported the hiring and mentoring of many
        Master's students, and is largely responsible for the
        support of at least two Ph.D. students. Moreover, research
        conducted under DIG is having impact beyond computer
        science as well. For example, in collaboration with social
        scientists, we are constructing and visualizing a social
        network of sex workers in the United States using
        backpage.com webpages, in order to better understand the
        domain.</p>

        system, both at ISWC 2017 and, more recently, at AAAI 2018,
        where the system was nominated for a Best Demonstration
        award. We presented the problem of investigative search as
        a case study and video at CHI<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id=

      <p>The DIG graphical user interface (GUI) and early
      information extraction modules in DIG were already
      constructed within a few months of program start in 2014, in
      collaboration with our user interface partner (Next Century
      Corporation). The second year (2015-2016) was spent on
      building an advanced search engine for the noisy knowledge
      graphs ingested by DIG. Throughout this period, the primary
      domain that DIG was being tested on was the human trafficking
      domain, due to both the technical difficulties entailed by
      the domain, as well as its potential for real-world impact.
      In the final year (2016-2017), the different strands of
      research in DIG were packaged into a final system called
      myDIG that allows users to construct domain-specific
      knowledge graphs in arbitrary domains. myDIG was evaluated by
      investigative users in multiple domains throughout 2017, and
      a final ‘packathon’ testing the capabilities of the system
      recently concluded, with successful results, in the first
      week of November 2017 (when the Memex program officially
      concluded).</p>

      <p>The Domain-specific Insight Graph (DIG) project was funded
      under the DARPA Memex program to address important challenges
      in domain-specific search. DIG successfully showed that good
      use of Web technology, especially knowledge graph
      construction from Web data, can be used to address many of
      the challenges. Recently, DIG has also been used for social
      science, and is continuing to be expanded in scope and
      capability through support from other projects. Some
      use-cases that DIG is now being used to support include
      causal exploration, search and inference involving
      time-series, research support for geopolitical forecasting,
      and multi-modal knowledge graphs. We are continuing to
      maintain the project, and are committed to keeping it free,
      open-source and easy to use.</p>
