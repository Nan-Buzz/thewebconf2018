        <p><small>Inspired by the World Wide Web, the Web of Data
        is a network of interlinked data fragments. One of the main
        advantages of the Web of Data is that all of its content is
        processable by machines. However, this also has its
        drawbacks when it comes to monetization of the content:
        advertisements and donations—two important financial motors
        in the World Wide Web—do not translate into the Web of Data
        as they rely on exposing the user to advertisement/call for
        donations.</small></p>
        <p><small>The remedy this situation, we propose two
        different monetization strategies for the Web of Data. The
        first strategy involves a marketplace where users can buy
        data in an integrated way. The second strategy allows third
        parties to promote certain data. In return, the sponsors
        pay money whenever a user follows a link contained in the
        sponsored data. We identified two different kind of
        data—commercial and sponsored data—which can benefit from
        the two respective monetization strategies. With our work,
        we propose solutions to the problem of financing the
        creation and maintenance of content in the Web of
        Data.</small></p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">1</span> Problem</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The <em>Web of Data</em> (WoD) is an extension of the
      World Wide Web (WWW) to facilitate the exchange and
      processing of data which is distributed over the Web. In the
      WoD, data is exposed using a machine-processable,
      semantically annotated data model, the <em>Resource
      Description Framework (RDF) data model</em>. Using this data
      model, <em>machines</em> can access data
      <em>autonomously</em> on behalf of humans according to some
      task specifications. Another advantage of the RDF data model
      is that data sources can be queried in a federated fashion
      without agreeing on a common scheme beforehand. Even though
      the WoD is an extension of the WWW, accessing data in the WoD
      is more similar to querying one big, decentralized database
      than browsing web pages. Whilst this has the before-mentioned
      advantages, it also has its disadvantages. One of these
      disadvantages is that most <em>monetization strategies</em>
      for data publishers from the WWW do not translate easily to
      the WoD. Typical monetization strategies in the WWW include
      <em>advertisement</em>, <em>donations</em>, and
      <em>subsidies</em>.</p>
      <p>Advertisement is arguably the biggest financial motor in
      the WWW. The WWW offers the opportunity to customize
      advertisement to the user and target specific user groups in
      a way unprecedented in any other media. A <em>publisher</em>
      of Web content can embed ads into the <em>presentation</em>
      of the actual content to create the required impressions
      (which may be converted into clicks and actions) for which
      the advertiser is paying. If we would want to translate this
      advertisement mechanism to the WoD, we would need a way to
      embed advertisement into the presentation of the RDF data.
      However, unlike the markup language HTML, the RDF data model
      does not provide the means to <em>dictate</em> how certain
      data elements should be presented to the user. Indeed, the
      mere concept of machine-processable data opposes the idea of
      exposing the consumer of the data (which could be a human or
      a machine) to advertisement. For example, the query language
      SPARQL [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>],
      which can be used to query RDF data, allows to
      <em>project</em> a query answer to a set of variables which
      are of interest. Thus, meta-data like advertisement can
      easily be filtered out. Of course, it is always possible to
      introduce advertisement at the interface between the human
      and the machine which accesses the WoD. However, such
      advertisements would be controlled by the publisher of the
      respective interface and not by the publisher of the original
      data. The data publisher would not benefit from such an
      advertisement strategy, which is the main concern of our
      research.</p>
      <p>Donations are another important source of money in the
      WWW. This monetization strategy relies on users’
      <em>appreciation</em> of the Web content to a degree where
      they are voluntarily donating money to keep the service
      alive. If a publisher wants to finance its service through
      donations, a crucial part is to make the consumers
      <em>aware</em> of the need of financial support and instruct
      them how to donate. This problem should not be
      underestimated. As [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] shows, a significant part of the
      users is not aware that there is a possibility to donate to
      Wikipedia<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, a website which is mainly
      financed through donations, or do not know how to donate. To
      remedy this situation, publishers which do rely on donations
      occasionally put banners on their websites to call for
      donations, for example. In the WoD, this problem is much more
      pronounced. Similar to what we have already discussed about
      advertisement, it is also not straightforward to embed calls
      for donations into RDF data. In the end, calls for donations
      can be seen as a kind of advertisement where the advertiser
      is also the publisher. In addition, users might simply not be
      aware that they are using the data of a certain publisher,
      especially if the data is part of a federation. Even if the
      RDF data contains some attribution about the source of the
      data, similar to advertisement, such meta-data can be
      filtered out. As a result, publishers in the WoD might not be
      able to create the required <em>awareness</em> to trigger
      donations.</p>
      <p>Besides advertisement and donations, subsidies play also
      an important role in financing Web content. Unlike the former
      two, subsidies do actually also apply to the WoD setting.
      Most current datasets on the WoD which are not maintained by
      enthusiasts are subsidized either by governments via data
      access laws or by research grants. However, subsidies cannot
      be considered an actual monetization strategy, as they
      basically delegate the problem to somebody else.</p>
      <p><strong>Problem statement:</strong> Without new
      monetization strategies, many promising datasets will be
      poorly maintained or disappear as there will be not enough
      funds to keep the data up-to-date and the servers running. To
      solve this problem, we identify, model, and evaluate two new
      monetization strategies for the WoD.</p>
      <p>The first monetization strategy focuses on the consumer of
      the WoD data to finance the data publishers. In the second
      monetization strategy a third party, the sponsor, finances
      the data. These two monetization strategies can be applied to
      two different types of data: The former strategy is
      applicable to data for which a consumer is willing to pay,
      which we will call <em>commercial data</em>. The latter
      strategy is applicable to data some sponsor is willing to
      promote, which we will call <em>sponsored data</em>.</p>

        <p>The idea to charge customers for accessing data is
        already implemented in the WWW. <em>Bloomberg</em><a class=
        "fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>,
        <em>LexisNexis</em><a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
        "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and <em>Thomson
        Reuters</em><a class="fn" href="#fn4" id=
        "foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> charge customers high fees for
        accessing their data, primarily using subscription-based
        models. All these examples have in common that they can
        sell their whole data offering charging quasi-monopolistic
        prices&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. Also, for relational databases,
        markets have been proposed which sell data using
        arbitrage-free pricing schemes&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. In the work of
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>], the
        negative externalities of giving away data are considered
        when selling them using an auction mechanism.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, none of these marketplaces allow a
        customer to join datasets from different providers, which
        is an important aspect of the WoD scenario we are
        investigating. In addition, to the best of our knowledge,
        none of these marketplaces considers partial answers due to
        value or budget constraints.</p>
        <p>In a pilot study, [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>] laid the foundation of our
        research by simulating a marketplace for the WoD. In
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>], we
        first introduced the idea of using a double-auction to sell
        data on the WoD. Finally, in [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>] we introduced our model for a
        marketplace which allows customers to buy data from
        decentralized sellers in an integrated way. In contrast to
        previous models, we focused on maximizing the customers
        utility given all available data.</p>

            Search Auctions</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The Generalized Second Price (GSP), which was introduced
        by Google in 2002 and replaced the first price models,
        became an industry standard for sponsored search auctions
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. The
        main advantage of the GSP auction is that it prevents
        “cycling” patterns, a situation where repeatedly prices
        gradually rise and then suddenly drop&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]. Another alternative to
        first price models is the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
        auction&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. This auction has the advantage of
        being <em>truthful</em>, meaning that no bidder has an
        incentive to lie about his or her valuation of the outcome
        of the auction. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] proposed a new auction mechanism
        where bidders can impose additional constraints on the
        exact location where they want their ad to appear, as a
        bidder might have a value for the mere appearance of the
        ad, even if the ad is not clicked by the user.</p>
        <p>So far, none of these auction models have been applied
        to the WoD setting. One reason is that, as discussed in
        Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-2">1</a>, online
        advertisement from the WWW does not translate to the WoD.
        However, as we have shown in [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>], the auction techniques can
        nevertheless be applied in the WoD setting, although not in
        the way they were originally designed for.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">3</span> Proposed
          Approach</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Our basic approach is to formulate two different
      monetization strategies for commercial and sponsored
      data.</p>
      <p>The main characteristics of commercial data is that the
      consumer has a higher <em>value</em> for <em>consuming</em>
      the data than any other entity (including, but not limited
      to, the data publisher) has in <em>exposing</em> the customer
      to the data. The value indicates the willingness to pay for
      consuming and exposing the data, respectively. Examples of
      commercial data are data about consumer behaviors or stock
      exchange data.</p>
      <p>The main characteristics of sponsored data is that there
      is an entity, which we call the <em>sponsor</em>, that has a
      higher value for <em>exposing</em> the consumer to the data
      than the consumer has for <em>consuming</em> the data.
      Sponsored data is basically any data which is typically
      included in advertisements. In contrast to traditional
      advertisement, however, sponsored data is explicitly
      requested by the consumer and does not represent additional
      information or even a distraction from the requested data.
      Examples of sponsored data are information about hotels and
      restaurants or data about goods for sale.</p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.1</span> A
            Marketplace for Commercial Data</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>To answer the first research question, we propose a
        marketplace for commercial data in the WoD. The main
        feature of our marketplace is that a customer can
        <em>combine</em> data from different data publishers in an
        integrated way, which means that the customer can access
        the data of all participating data publishers as if there
        would be only one big database. The customer does not have
        to pay for all the available data, however. Instead, a
        customer can submit a query and will be charged only for
        those triples (the smallest possible data fragments) which
        are precisely needed to form a certain query answer. In
        addition, the customer can decide how small or big the
        query answer should be.</p>
        <p>Without using such a marketplace, a user would have to
        buy individual triples directly from the different data
        publishers. While this is possible, there is a major
        drawback of this approach when data from more than one data
        publisher have to be joined: It is very hard for the
        customer to estimate which triples of one publisher will
        actually join with the triples of another publisher. Hence,
        a customer might either waste money on triples which do not
        join or miss a part of the query answer because some
        triples were not bought. As we have shown in [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>], join
        estimation techniques are suffering a lot from
        false-positive matches in the WoD setting and hence, we
        cannot expect that a customer would be able to use such
        techniques to buy exactly those triples which are needed to
        form a specific query answer. Only a query execution can
        reveal the true contribution and value of the publishers’
        triples. Hence, we argue that a market for the WoD has to
        execute a given query on the publishers’ data
        <em>before</em> the decision can be made which triples
        should be bought by the customer. Figure <a class="fig"
        href="#fig1">1</a> shows the necessary steps in our
        marketplace:</p>
        <ol class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list1" label="(1)">The marketplace receives a
          query from the customer and executes it on the available

          marketplace the indicated price of the selected
          triples.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>My first research question focuses on the customer's
        buying decision, which we call the <em>allocation

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.2</span> A
            Delayed-Answer Auction for Sponsored Data</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>For the second research question, we propose a
        slot-auction similar to the auctions used for sponsored
        search results. In this auction, sponsors pay money if a
        user follows a certain link contained in a query answer. To
        motivate sponsors to pay for such link visits, we need a
        way to prioritize those links which receive a higher bid
        from those links with lower or no bid. For this, we
        introduce delays into the delivery of the query answer.
        Records containing links with high bids are delivered more
        quickly than the records with lower bids. By introducing
        such different delays, we create a ranking of the different
        records of a query answer. The ranking we introduce works
        similar to the rankings of advertisement slots in sponsored
        search results. Hence, we can apply the auction techniques
        which originate from sponsored search auctions to this new
        setting.</p>
        <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> illustrates the
        process of our new auction concept. Like in the marketplace
        from Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-7">3.1</a>, we have
        a user who submits a query to our system and the query gets
        executed on the data of all participating publishers. This
        time, however, the user does not select a part of the query
        answer. Instead, the complete query answer is delivered to
        the user. Different delays are assigned to the different
        records of the query answer, depending on how much the
        sponsors bid on certain links contained in the records.
        Records with less delay have a higher chance of being
        considered by the user and hence, the likelihood of a link
        visit is higher. If the user visits a certain link, the
        sponsor has to pay a certain price to the auctioneer. The
        prices are calculated using the VCG
        mechanism&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

            <h3><span class="section-number">4.1</span> Marketplace
            for Commercial Data</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>For the marketplace for commercial data, different parts
        of the market have to be modelled. The first part models
        how the necessary meta-data can be extracted from the
        different data publishers during query execution (part 1 in
        Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>). In our model,
        the publishers’ data is organized into <em>data
        products</em>. A data product is a collection of RDF
        triples that all have the same meta-data (including the
        price). We use RDF statements to describe the meta-data
        about a data product. This allows us to access the data and
        the meta-data of the data products using a single,
        federated SPARQL query. Additionally, a user can use the
        meta-data directly in the query to restrict the query
        answer based on the specific needs.</p>
        <p>A second important aspect of our model for the
        marketplace is the selection of the query answer (part 2 in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>). Choosing an
        appropriate subset of the complete query answer can be
        modelled as an integer programming problem, assuming that
        the value for the query answer is a linear function with
        respect to the containing records. However, solving such a
        problem is NP-hard. If the value is not linear but
        monotonically decreasing, we cannot formulate the problem
        as an integer programming problem.</p>
        <p>The query execution of our marketplace is implemented
        using the federated querying engine FedX [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>]. In traditional
        federated SPARQL query execution, a SPARQL query is split
        up into subqueries which are sent to different sources.
        Combining the query answers from the different subqueries
        results in the complete query answer. Instead of sending
        the subqueries directly to the endpoints, we have to
        rewrite each subquery to retrieve also all meta-data about
        the different data products.</p>
        <p>The selection of the query answer is implemented using
        two different approaches:</p>
        <ol class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list6" label="(1)">Using the commercial solver
          CPLEX<a class="fn" href="#fn5" id=
          "foot-fn5"><sup>5</sup></a>. This approach is only
          possible if the selection can be modelled as an integer
          programming problem.<br />
          </li>
          <li id="list7" label="(2)">Using our own greedy
          algorithm. This approach is also possible if the value is
          monotonically decreasing.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>To evaluate the two different approaches, we are using
        two different metrics: the runtime of the algorithms (which
        establishes their feasibility) and the quality of their
        selection. The quality of a specific selection of a query
        answer is expressed by its <em>utility</em>, which is the
        <em>value</em> a user has for a specific selection minus
        the <em>price</em> the customer has to pay.</p>

            Delayed-Answer Auction</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The model for the delayed-answer auction is based on the
        slot auctions for sponsored search results. In this model,
        we have different slots with decreasing likelihood of being
        selected by the user. Since a query answer is a set of
        records, there is no inherent ordering of the different
        records and hence, all records have initially the same
        likelihood of being selected. To create such an ordering
        artificially, we have to introduce different delays for
        different records. Each record inside a query answer gets
        assigned to a specific slot which determines the delay.</p>
        <p>Even though our delayed-answer auction is similar to
        sponsored search auctions, we need a new click model for
        this new setting. The model we are using assumes that a
        user is able to judge the relevancy of a link upon
        receiving the query answer and hence, will visit at most
        one link. Unlike links in the WWW, in the WoD, the user can
        judge the relevancy of a link by the information embedded
        in the query answer.</p>
        <p>The delays for the different records are important
        parameters of our auction which have to be chosen by the
        auctioneer. These parameters add a new dimensionality to
        the slot auctions and do not have any counterpart in
        traditional slot auctions used in sponsored search
        auctions. Hence, it is crucial to understand how these
        parameters influence the auction and how an auctioneer can
        optimize on them. Hence, we perform a theoretical analysis
        of how the parameters can be optimized. In addition, we
        perform simulations which illustrates the choice of the
        parameters on social welfare (the total generated wealth)
        and revenue for the auctioneer.</p>

      commercial data (Research Question <a class="lst" href=

        </header>
        <p>To evaluate the two different approaches sketched in
        Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-10">4.1</a>, we tested
        both algorithms on 17 FedBench [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>] queries. We used the
        metrics described in Section <a class="sec" href=
        "#sec-10">4.1</a> for this evaluation.</p>
        <p>With respect to the utility, the first approach using
        CPLEX and the second approach using our greedy algorithm
        are very close to each other. We observed that our greedy
        algorithm reaches more than 90% of the utility of CPLEX in
        15 out of 17 queries. For the other two queries, our greedy
        algorithm reached at least 80%. At the same time, the
        greedy algorithm runs in most cases between 1 and 3 orders
        of magnitude faster than CPLEX. Figure <a class="fig" href=
        "#fig3">3</a> compares the approach using CPLEX, which we
        call the Integer Rule, and our own algorithm, which we call
        the Greedy Rule.</p>

        </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>In a different evaluation, we showed that CPLEX is very
        sensitive to the diversity of the query answer and that for
        some parameter ranges, CPLEX is not able to find an optimal
        solution within a time-limit of 12 hours.</p>
        <p>As our results show, the two approaches under
        investigation—Integer Rule and Greedy Rule—can be used to
        solve the allocation problem. While using CPLEX guarantees
        an optimal solution, our own algorithm can achieve similar
        results in a much shorter time-frame, usually. This gives
        an answer to Research Question <a class="lst" href=
        "#list4">RQ1</a>: The allocation problem can in most cases
        solved efficiently with both approaches. In some cases, the
        Integer Rule is superior to the Greedy Rule. In most cases,
        however, the Greedy Rule can be a good and fast
        alternative. Finally, for some cases, the Integer Rule is
        not feasible due to the excessive runtime.</p>

        <p>We analyzed the properties of the delayed-answer auction
        and found that in general it is not possible to optimize
        both revenue and social welfare with the same set of
        parameters for the delays. Optimal revenue and optimal
        social welfare have in common that they both require that
        part of the query answer is delayed indefinitely. Such an
        approach might damp the user's experience, however, who
        only receives part of all available data. Our simulations
        showed that the parameters for optimizing revenue and
        optimizing social welfare differ a lot when there are is a
        small set of bids which are much higher than the remaining
        bids.</p>

      </header>
      <p>To create financial incentives to publish content in the
      Web of Data, we proposed two different strategies, one for
      commercial and one for sponsored data. As discussed in
      Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-12">5</a>, we already
      established some results regarding these two strategies.</p>
      <p>For the first strategy, we compared two different ways how
      a consumer can select a subset of a query answer and compared
      their performance with respect to runtime and utility. What
      is left for future work is to investigate how data providers
      can determine the best price for their data. We believe that
      such optimal price can be learned, for example by using
      reinforced learning techniques. We also need to explore how
      well subscription-based models can be applied to our new
      setting. Finally, our marketplace offers new possibilities
      for market-aware query optimizations which considers the
      costs we impose on the data providers by executing queries on
      their servers.</p>
      <p>For the second strategy, we already did a theoretical
      analysis of our auction setting and a simulation which showed
      some interesting properties of our model. However, we are
      still missing an evaluation of our method using real-world
      data. For this, we plan to use datasets from traditional ad
      auctions for web search. We have to investigate how these
      datasets can be applied to our new setting.</p>
