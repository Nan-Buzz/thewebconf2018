        cluster analysis, the UIs similarity perceptual space was
        identified. (2) Eliciting participants’ overall preference

      </header>
      <p>Effective design of UI for mobile handheld devices
      facilitates user adoption of mobile commerce, and it is of
      great importance to leave a good impression on mobile
      shopping apps. When choosing how to attract the user's
      attention, designers face a variety of choices, and they
      generally make decisions based on anecdotes and intuition.
      Some design elements are widely used, perhaps because of
      designers believe they are effective at capturing users’
      attentions, but they end up annoying and repelling users.
      Consequently, this research aims to identify the differences,
      if any, between users’ and designers’ perceptions of mobile
      shopping app UIs. This study mainly focused on: (1) What are
      the types of shopping app UIs and what are the differences
      among these UIs design features? (2) Explore whether there
      are differences between users and designers’ preferences for
      shopping app UIs.</p>

      <p>In the similarity experiment, the experimental element was
      the 40 most popular mobile shopping app UIs, on the Apple
      iTunes Store of China. Participants included 24 designers and
      24 users. Participants were asked to sort together shopping
      app UIs based on their perceived similarity.</p>
      <p>In the preference experiment, 40 UIs were the same as the
      previous stage. Participants included 35 designers and 35
      users. They were asked to use a 9-point Likert scale to rate
      the 40 shopping UIs according to their perceptual
      preferences.</p>

        </header>
        <p>To explore participants’ perceptions of the proximities
        among the shopping app UIs, the sorting data was analyzed
        using DISTATIS approach [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib1">1</a>]. The results showed an UI similarity
        perceptual space from which critical dimensions influencing
        user perception of shopping UIs could be delineated. The
        factor scores are given in Table <a class="tbl" href=
        "#tb1">1</a>, and the projections of the UIs on the first
        three dimensions are shown in <a class="fig" href=
        "#fig1">Fig. 1</a> and <a class="fig" href="#fig2">Fig.
        2</a>. Together, these three dimensions explained 78% of
        the inertia of the compromise matrix, which indicated that
        the interpretation of the results can be restricted to
        these three dimensions. Paired with the cluster analysis,
        the 40 UI samples plotted in this perceptual space were
        appropriately divided into three typical groups. The
        perceptual space from the DISTATIS analysis reveals
        distribution trends in the visual features of the UI
        representations. Cluster analysis showed three current
        typical shopping UIs.</p>

        <p>User participants preferred UI No. 22 the most (M=5.94;
        SD=1.84) while designer participants liked UI No. 16 the
        most (M=5.83; SD=2.36). In order to more detailed
        understanding of the differences between users’ and
        designers’ preferences and design features of ideal
        shopping UIs, the three dimensions of perceptual space were
        needed. Therefore, according to user and designer
        participants’ preferences score for 40 interface samples,
        we obtain a ternary diagram [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib2">2</a>] (<a class="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>
        <em>)</em>, which shows the participants’ preferences
        toward the 40 UIs. The ternary diagram is a triangular
        diagram which displays the proportion of three variables
        that sum to a constant and which does so using barycentric
        coordinates [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib3">3</a>]. In <a class="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>,
        the three variables represent the three preference
        dimensions (Like, So-So, Dislike), each of these points is
        the composition of three variable. Based on the similarity
        space previously plotted by DISTATIS, three UI groups were
        presented in different colors and different symbols in
        <a class="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>. It shows the users’
        preferences map is relatively dispersed, while the
        designers’ preferences map is relatively concentrated.
        Based on the three UI types, it is obvious that users
        preferred the UIs in group 1, while designers preferred the
        UIs that are relatively focus on group 2. It indicates that
        users and designers have significant disagreements about
        their preferences towards to the UIs in group 1 and group
        2. The common characteristics of users preferred UIs
        included the use of warm colors, high density and rich
        functions (search bar+1/5banner+push bar+2 rows of icon+
        push module + bottom navigation). However, the common
        features of designers preferred interfaces included the use
        of neutral colors, low density and simple function (top
        navigation, +2 big banners+ bottom navigation).</p>

          CONCLUSIONS</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>This paper describes a case study exploring the
      differences between users’ and designers’ perceptions of
      shopping app UI designs. Shopping app UIs, including various
      design features, were chosen as elements. Participants were
      asked to sort these UIs according to visual similarities and
      differences. Then three typical shopping UIs were identified
      through cluster analysis. Next, users’ and designers’
      preferences of the UIs were identified. Users mostly
      preferred interfaces which mainly focus on group 1, while
      designers’ preference of interfaces were relatively
      concentrated in group 2. Designers tended to prefer the UI
      with overall layout, while users preferred the UI with
      subdivision layout. The results highlight the perception
      differences between users and designers in shopping app UI
      preferences, which can help designers better understand the
      target users and reduce the perception differences with
      users.</p>
