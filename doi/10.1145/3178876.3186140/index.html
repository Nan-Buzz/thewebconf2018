        <p><small>As social recommendations such as friend
        suggestions and people to follow become increasingly
        popular and influential on the growth of social media, we
        find that prominent social recommendation algorithms can
        exacerbate the under-representation of certain demographic
        groups at the top of the social hierarchy. To study this
        imbalance in online equal opportunities, we leverage new
        Instagram data and offer for the first time an analysis
        that studies the effect of gender, homophily and growth
        dynamics under social recommendations. Our mathematical
        analysis demonstrates the existence of an algorithmic glass
        ceiling that exhibits all the properties of the
        metaphorical social barrier that hinders groups like women
        or people of color from attaining equal representation.
        What raises concern is that our proof shows that under
        fixed minority and homophily parameters the algorithmic
        effect is systematically larger than the glass ceiling
        generated by the spontaneous growth of social networks. We
        discuss ways to address this concern in future
        design.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>

      </header>
      <p>Geographical distance and social prejudice have a long
      history of preventing equitable access to information and
      commercial transactions. One hope of an increasingly
      connected world is to at least take a step towards equal
      opportunities by removing some of those barriers. But, in the
      social networks now governing the knowledge, jobs and deals
      one can seek, what matters most today is one's position in a
      graph of advantageous connections. Those connections take
      time to set up and maintain. Recommender systems play a key
      role in assisting individuals in directing their social
      sharing activity towards the most valuable sources and
      partners. But under which conditions can we ensure that those
      suggestions are not reproducing, or worse,
      <em>reinforcing</em> our historical biases, combined with a
      cloudy illusion of objectivity? One would <em>a priori</em>
      expect similarity metrics, usually the basis of recommender
      systems, to contribute to sustaining disparities among
      various groups. We show much more: using empirical evidence
      from newly collected data on Instagram and a rigorous
      analysis of mathematical models, we prove that prominent
      recommender algorithms reinforce the <em>rate at which
      disparity grows</em>.</p>
      <p>While the issues introduced affect countless situations
      where suggestions are algorithmically produced, we focus for
      concreteness on an elementary case: the suggestion to build a
      new edge with another participant. Features like “People you
      may know” (Facebook), “Who to follow” (Twitter), “Suggested
      Accounts” (Instagram) are now pervasive across most popular
      social network services. Their impact on the evolution of
      connection graph has been demonstrated&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. To quote the Chairs’
      opening statement from the FATREC workshop (2017), “If
      recommendation applications did not alter participants’
      behaviors, those applications would not exist”. As a thought
      experiment, one may picture the <em>organic</em> growth of a
      connection graph (i.e.,&nbsp;the addition of edges occurring
      in absence of any suggestions) as a reference point. An
      <em>algorithmic</em> growth, in contrast, results from
      suggestions. An algorithm to determine new edges to suggest
      is generally evaluated either via its <em>predictive
      power</em> (i.e.,&nbsp;does it anticipate organic growth?),
      or its <em>hit rate</em> (i.e.,&nbsp;are its suggestions well
      received?). We ask a different question: are there safe
      (respectively unsafe) conditions under which a well-know
      metric of disparate impact is no worse (respectively strictly
      worse) for algorithmic growth than for organic growth?
      Unfortunately, our study demonstrates that no safe conditions
      exist outside trivial cases for frequently used algorithms
      and three definitions of disparate impact. However, we
      quickly note that future suggestion algorithms could be
      designed to account for and correct that bias, and offer a
      short discussion of simple ways to address this in future
      design.</p>
      <p>This paper presents the following contributions:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="•">To better investigate the role of
        gender in organic and artificial growth of social networks,
        we conduct a large crawl of the Instagram service and its
        active relationships (comments and likes). The graph has a
        moderate but distinct majority of female profiles.
        Nevertheless, with high statistical confidence, the organic
        growth we captured exhibits traces of a so-called <em>glass
        ceiling</em> preventing females from rising to the most
        commented and liked profiles. But that pales by comparison
        with the <em>algorithmic glass ceiling</em> which is
        observed when two well known algorithms are used: only in
        that case do we observe a drastic gap arising in the degree
        distributions by gender. A sudden decrease of female
        representation at the top ensues (Section&nbsp;<a class=
        "sec" href="#sec-6">3</a>).<br />
        </li>
        <li id="list2" label="•">We follow a mathematical analysis
        of the effect of random walks on dynamic graphs to
        investigate the conditions creating <em>algorithmic glass
        ceiling</em>. Previous works highlighted how combining an
        uneven population with homophily prepares the ground for
        glass ceiling in the typical organic growth of preferential
        attachment. Our method allows one to study the eventual
        perturbation effect of a recommendation algorithm as the
        result of a new polynomial fixed point equation. This is
        used to prove two major results: First, a simple
        recommendation algorithm leveraging random walks is not
        only subject to some bias, it also reinforces the rate at
        which a gender gap arises. Second, we prove numerically
        that this effect is always noticeable for observed
        parameters (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
        "#sec-11">4</a>).<br />
        </li>
        <li id="list3" label="•">We provide two important
        theoretical follow ups. First, we address the apparent
        contradiction between empirical observations (showing glass
        ceiling against a female majority) and mathematical results
        (predicting glass ceiling at the expense of a minority).
        The two are reconciled by an extension of the above model
        we call <em>differentiated homophily</em> where the two
        groups exhibit varying propensity to favor their own peers.
        We prove that this can flip the glass ceiling effect to
        come at the expense of a majority. We document that,
        indeed, male accounts on Instagram exhibit much stronger
        homophily among each others when compared with female
        accounts. Finally, as a proof of concept we quickly
        describe a simple ”rejection method” for an improved random
        walk recommendation algorithm. This approach makes
        stringent assumptions but offers the advantage of making
        the algorithmic growth more equitable than organic growth
        (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-18">6</a>).<br />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As we detail immediately below, the sharp amplification of
      the glass ceiling effect by an algorithm is an entirely new
      result, which has no equivalent that we know of. It is a
      special case of a widely open problem: how to correct a
      seemingly neutral algorithm when the structure it exploits is
      not fair to begin with. Some might argue the algorithm is
      simply legitimate as it leverages sensible metrics and is not
      <em>solely</em> responsible for the unfairness found in the
      system. That remains however unsatisfactory for anyone
      wishing more equal opportunities for all. Those who abide by
      a strict fairness requirement (e.g.,&nbsp;defined as
      statistical parity&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>] or equality of opportunity), may
      suggest a correction step be applied. Unfortunately, without
      a deep understanding of the cause and reverberation of bias,
      any post-hoc correction can be harshly debated. Our paper
      offers an alternative way: identify some structural causes of
      the emerging unfairness, and require algorithms to be
      designed in a way that leverages structure while carefully
      avoiding those biases in the presence of the above
      conditions.</p>

      <p>Our work addresses the fairness concerns recently raised
      for decisions informed by algorithms run on Big Data. Even
      with no explicit intention to discriminate and without access
      to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, such
      algorithms can potentially create undue
      biases&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>].
      Most related work on this issue centers on binary
      classification tasks such as loan approval, with a goal to
      maintain operational efficiency under various conditions of
      equal treatment or opportunity&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. Similarly, fairness was
      studied for word embeddings&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] and nodes
      ranking&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. But to our knowledge, an analysis
      of social recommendation and the effect of graph algorithms
      has yet to be conducted. The main difference is that one must
      analyze the effect of network structure.</p>
      <p>We build on a growing body of evidence that online
      services (including Twitter[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>], TaskRabbit&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>], and
      Airbnb&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>])
      can reproduce well-known prejudices against historically
      under-represented groups. Issues raised include disparate
      treatment and evidence of a metaphorical <em>glass
      ceiling</em>. The latter denotes an invisible barrier
      preventing given demographics (most commonly females) to
      reach superior levels of recognition. This manifests itself
      when (1) chances of advancement to a higher level are uneven
      for members of that demographic group, (2) when it is not
      explained by task-relevant characteristics, and (3) when that
      inequality increases for higher and higher levels. We observe
      that these three conditions hold for the Instagram dataset,
      in particular for people who like and comment on others’
      posts. In addition, we collect for the first time the graph
      connecting individuals within our crawl. This leads us to
      observe whether algorithms (in this case, profile
      recommendation) would alleviate or reinforce this trend.
      Recent work suggested that the growth of Twitter was also
      impacted by recommendation&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. Combining such previous results
      with ours raises concerns that the current engineered growth
      of social media may in the end systematically misrepresent
      entire groups of the population.</p>
      <p>Homophily, a tendency of individuals to favor interactions
      with similar peers – widely established to hold for social
      networks and online communites&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] – is at the core of our
      result. The result most relevant to ours is a recent proof
      that rich-get-richer dynamics combined with homophily
      naturally exacerbate the advantage of a majority
      group&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>].
      That model can explain why, as in other services,
      <em>organic</em> interaction on Instagram exhibits the
      aforementioned bias against some of its participants. We, on
      the other hand, introduce random walk dynamics, which closely
      capture the way recommender systems operate.</p>

        <p><em>Instagram activity graph.</em>. We performed a crawl
        on Instagram's public profiles starting from the founder of
        Instagram, Kevin Systrom. Through the Instagram API, we
        collected profile information and recursively followed the
        lists of followers. For each profile, we collected the
        name, username, unique id, and crawled the meta-data for
        each photo, which include: unique photo id, number of
        likes, number of comments, hashtags, location, timestamp,
        tagged users, and a random subset of 3-5 likes and comments
        with their authors. For each user, we aggregated this
        information in obtaining the total number of likes,
        comments, tags, first and last photo timestamp, and the set
        of used hashtags. In total, we collected 115,796,284 photos
        from 245,038 different users over multiple months of 2014
        and 2015. While the data might not encompass the full
        diversity of Instagram users, it is sufficient to obtain
        statistically significant results most of the time.</p>
        <p><em>Gender inference</em>. Our gender inference method
        adapted from&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>] leverages first name and social
        security data. Mislove et al. inferred the gender balance
        using a dataset of names from social security data ranging
        between 1890 and 2015. We only included name data between
        1940 and 2007, as reported demographic statistics predict
        that less than 4% of Instagram users would be born before
        that&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>].</p>
        <p>We filtered reported names for those having at least 50
        occurrences for either men or women, with at least 95% of a
        single gender. This created 32,676 unique unambiguous first
        names, which we use to label 92,935 Instagram users. That
        is approximately 38% of the population. Among those 49,583,
        or 53%, are labeled as female, and 43,352, or 47%, as male.
        We tested a small sample of classified names by hand,
        obtaining 97% accuracy. We call this graph the
        <strong>Instagram-labeled-core</strong>.</p>
        <p><em>The graph of likes and comments</em>. Users of
        <strong>Instagram-labeled-core</strong> collectively posted
        44,725,840 photos, out of which we randomly sample 1
        million photos. For each photo in this set, we looked at
        the 3-5 likes and comments received and extracted all
        authors, keeping those only when their gender could be
        labelled as above. We create an edge between the authors of
        the pictures and the authors of the likes or comments. We
        choose to focus on likes and comments as interactions,
        since they are a more involved way of connecting online
        than followers.</p>
        <p>This created a graph of <strong>553,628 nodes</strong>
        and <strong>652,931 edges</strong>, where everyone has a
        labeled gender. Here, we obtained 54.43% users labeled as
        female, and 45.56% users labeled as male, showing that
        gender balance appears the same as above. This graph is
        called <strong>Instagram activity</strong> and is the main
        graph we will use in the rest of this article. Note that it
        is much larger, authors of comments may not have been in
        the original crawl and hence we do not have all meta-data
        about their activity and following. Building a graph
        implies that a user's degree count how many distinct (and
        labeled) users either received or gave a comment or a liked
        to one of her pictures.</p>

        create a graph of co-authorship between authors for whom
        our inference method finds a gender. The resulting graph,

        <p>Instagram's ”Suggested accounts” feature was introduced
        after our data crawl. The data we collected is hence a
        representative view of an <em>organic growth</em>, which is
        how the network evolves from interaction in the absence of
        algorithmic suggestions.</p>
        <p>A rich body of literature focuses on the effect of
        gender in acquiring visibility and impact in the online
        world [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>] [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>] &nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>], where measures of
        wealth are redefined as volume of user-user interactions
        (such as the degree we defined above).</p>
        <p>We conducted multiple analyses reproducing methodology
        from papers cited above, that we briefly summarize for
        space reasons. First, in the
        <strong>Instagram-activity</strong> graph, we use Poisson
        Regression with no control variables. This analysis reveals
        that in the last quartile containing most prominent
        accounts, male users have an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of
        1.09*** (a 9% increase, where *** denotes statistical
        confidence <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for comment/like degree.
        All other quartiles show no effect of gender. The effect is
        however relatively small, and most prominent at the top
        0.1% which contains half a thousand nodes (see
        Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a>). In fact,
        among the top 5,000 or top 1%, women are statistically
        significant to have larger degrees up to 12%.</p>
        <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> further
        illustrates this effect in both the Instagram activity
        graph and the DBLP graph. For the Instagram dataset (a), we
        observe that while in the initial graph the disparity
        between the two genders is not very large (blue dots and
        circles), it is still present. While females make up 54% of
        the total population, they represent only 48% of those with
        degree &gt; 10 (which corresponds roughly to the top 1%
        most connected users), 54% of those with degree &gt; 100 (a
        subset which exhibits no particular gender imbalance), and
        45% of those with degree &gt; 2000.</p>
        <p>In summary, the organic growth we observe confirms a
        significant effect of gender. We obtain similar results
        (omitted here) when controlling for content productivity.
        Overall, women appear under-represented at the top,
        although they form the largest group, yet not completely
        excluded from large levels of recognitions. This motivates
        us to study how those biases change when Instagram's
        organic growth is complemented by recommendations.</p>

            Recommendation algorithms</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Recommendation algorithms typically leverage structure
        to find compatible matches among similar but not yet
        connected individuals. Many heuristics have been proposed
        and it is challenging to choose a representative subset of
        them. Two stand out from prior comprehensive
        comparisons:</p>
        <p><em>The Adamic-Adar index</em>. We first note that if
        algorithms were perfectly predictive and only suggested
        edges that nodes would have made in <em>organic
        growth</em>, we should not observe a significant effect. We
        therefore include social recommendation based on the
        Adamic-Adar index, as it is shown in [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>] to be the most accurate
        in prediction and therefore a conservative choice from a
        perturbation standpoint. The Adamic-Adar index adapts a
        simple rule, “choose node with maximum-common-neighbors” to
        avoid always recommending high degree nodes. Our own
        analysis of maximum-common-neighbors revealed that indeed
        that would be impractical and too simplistic to obtain
        sensible results, as suggestions are chosen in a restricted
        set. We define Adamic-Adar index between two nodes
        <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> as <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$(u,v) \rightarrow \sum
        \limits _{w \in \Gamma (u) \cap \Gamma (v)} 1/\log |\Gamma
        (w)|$</span></span> , where |<em>Γ</em>(<em>u</em>)|
        denotes all neighbors of <em>u</em>&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]. Note that in this
        index common neighbors that are very popular would carry a
        smaller weight than common neighbors with a smaller degree.
        For each node, the social recommendations is computed by
        finding another node <em>v</em> with largest index that is
        not already a neighbor (breaking ties randomly).</p>
        <p><em>Random Walk</em>. Another interesting comparison
        point would be an algorithm that best reproduces
        suggestions that are <em>actually given</em> today. That is
        a difficult task since many of the algorithms currently
        deployed are complex and often kept secret to keep
        competitors and cheaters at bay. To best address this need,
        we choose an algorithm based on a random walk of length 2,
        as it was deemed similar to real recommendations in the
        only article we know that had access to this proprietary
        data&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. This algorithm, in contrast with
        Adamic-Adar index, returns a random recommendation for each
        node <em>u</em>, by starting a random walk at a point
        <em>X</em> <sub>1</sub> = <em>u</em> and returning
        <em>v</em> with probability</p>

        because both algorithm, and indeed most recommendations,

          </div>

        <p>The natural equivalent of degree as a measure of
        recognition or wealth under recommendations is the number
        of users who get recommended to connect with you, i.e.,
        <em>frequency of recommendation</em>. For every node in the
        Instagram-activity graph and the DBLP graph, we computed a
        single recommendation and collected the frequency of
        various nodes to appear as suggestions, which relates to
        degree growth under such dynamics.</p>
        <p>We first present in Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
        "#tab2">2</a> results allowing a direct comparison to
        organic growth. We use Poisson Regression with the
        dependent variable as the frequency of recommendation under
        Adamic-Adar for the Instagram activity graph (note that the
        total population in this case is 295,919, <em>i.e.</em>
        individuals who have been recommended at least once).
        Omitted results for the random walk algorithm are similar.
        Here, one sees a more noticeable and consistent glass
        ceiling effect. All the population in the last quartile
        sees male with larger frequencies, and this trend always
        grows with higher degrees.</p>
        <p>While organic growth generates degree distributions for
        each gender that are hard to distinguish, it is immediately
        clear that the frequency of recommendation distribution for
        the Adamic-Adar algorithm exhibits a gap between males and
        females (Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>) for
        both the Instagram dataset and the selected DBLP dataset.
        This confirms and extends the results obtained by Avin et
        al&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>], where a gender bias is observed in
        the DBLP network.</p>
        <p>This gap, exhibited to grow in log-log scale, is a sign
        of different power coefficients governing the statistical
        chance to reach at least <em>x</em> recommendations,
        depending on gender. As one progressively selects to retain
        only the most successful individuals, the aforementioned
        effect translates into a sudden and accelerating drop of
        the observed fraction of females. That drop of female
        representation is illustrated on Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig"
        href="#fig1">1</a> in red for Adamic-Adar recommendations
        and green for the Random Walk, where the size of the circle
        drawn helps interpret the relative size of the selected
        group. The contrast with a similar statistic on organic
        growth shown in blue is remarkable.</p>
        <p>As females are the majority even in the set of
        recommended users, the effect of gender disparity in
        recommendations amplifies, since simple homophily would
        suggest that females should be recommended more throughout.
        This suggests that degree alone is not sufficient in
        creating wealth, and that homophily also plays a role and
        can go as far as inverting inequality.</p>
        <p>Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab3">3</a> shows this
        analysis for the initial graph, having as rows the whole
        set of nodes (split by Male and Female), and as columns the
        users to whom they are connected. For each row, we show the
        percentage of males and females, and in parenthesis the
        ratio to the actual percentage of males and females,
        respectively. We observe that users labeled as male are
        more homophilic than users labeled as females, showing an
        instance of differentiated homophily.</p>

        <p>We extend the organic growth model by adding sparse
        recommendations between existing nodes. Most recommendation
        algorithms [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>] rely on connecting nodes with one
        of distance-2 neighbors or friends-of-friends
        (<em>e.g.,</em>&nbsp;common neighbors, Adamic-Adar,
        Jaccard, random walks). For the purpose of this theoretical
        analysis, we focus on the random walk of length 2 (see
        Eq.<a class="eqn" href="#eq1">1</a> above), as it
        encompasses the general properties of such algorithms and
        makes theoretical analysis tractable. We assume that the

      <p>Our theoretical contribution is a novel analysis of how
      recommendation algorithms can produce an even higher bias
      than organic growth. In our analysis, we note that the
      algorithms we analyzed do not create bias <em>ex nihilo</em>,
      but simply amplify bias in networks where it exists. For that
      reason, we focus on the <em>Biased Preferential Attachment
      Model</em> with the added effect of randomness and
      recommendation through random walks. We first provide a novel
      analysis of the way a random walk of length 2 affects the
      evolution of the in-degree distribution of nodes in the
      network, and show that the in-degree distribution follows a
      power law with different coefficients for the red and blue
      nodes, respectively. We analyze the in-degree since the graph
      is directed and the out-degree is constant by
      construction.</p>
      <p>We use the formal definitions of the glass ceiling effect
      from Avin et al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>], which rely on defining individual
      wealth as the degree of a node, and collective wealth as the
      sum of individual wealth values. Thus, we denote by
      <em>R</em> the set of red nodes and by <em>B</em> the set of
      blue nodes, <em>β</em> <sub><em>i</em>, <em>t</em></sub> the
      number of red nodes, <em>u</em> <sub><em>i</em>,
      <em>t</em></sub> (<em>R</em>) as the sum of degrees of all
      <em>R</em> nodes after <em>t</em> recommendations following
      random walk (and similarly for blue nodes) for the organic
      model (<em>i</em> = 1) and the recommendation model
      (<em>i</em> = 2).</p>
      <p>Since an edge is added at each step, it makes sense to
      introduce <em>u<sub>t</sub></em> (<em>R</em>) =
      <em>tα<sub>t</sub></em> and <em>u<sub>t</sub></em>
      (<em>B</em>) = <em>t</em>(1 − <em>α<sub>t</sub></em> ) for
      the organic model, where <em>α<sub>t</sub></em> is
      equivalently defined as the sum of degree of the red nodes
      divided by the total sum of degree, or simply the fraction of
      edges created towards <em>R</em> nodes under the
      recommendation dynamics. We define similarly <em>α</em>
      <sub>2, <em>t</em></sub> for the recommendation model.</p>
      <p>Finally, we introduce some useful notation: <span class=

      depends on the dynamics of connection. Figure&nbsp;<a class=

      edges <em>X</em> <sub>1</sub> − <em>X</em> <sub>2</sub> and

      the probability for <em>X</em> <sub>1</sub> − <em>X</em>

      <p>As we have seen, homophily plays a central role in the
      creation of a glass ceiling effect, yet characterizing its
      contribution precisely becomes challenging in complex models.
      For populations exhibiting equal rates of homophily, our
      results show that the majority have an advantageous position.
      But what happens in the case of <em>differential
      homophily</em>, where some populations may accept to connect
      with more diverse individuals than others? A natural question
      is: can the homophily parameter be used advantageously by the
      minority population in reversing the glass ceiling effect? We
      explore this question below, showing that in cases where the
      minority has a higher homophily parameter, the hierarchy
      between the majority and minority populations can be
      reversed.</p>
      <p>For the organic growth model, define
      <em>ρ<sub>R</sub></em> and <em>ρ<sub>B</sub></em> as the
      accept probability for incoming red and blue nodes,
      respectively. A new growth function <em>F</em> (denoted
      <em>F<sub>d</sub></em> ) then occurs as <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathcal

          \right) \\ + (1 -\eta) \cdot \left(r \cdot \frac{x}{x +

      <p>Setting <em>ρ<sub>R</sub></em> &lt; <em>ρ<sub>B</sub></em>
      , we effectively allow the red population to fewer more
      incoming edges from <em>B</em> than the blue nodes accept
      from <em>R</em>, in a sense ”protecting” themselves. We show
      an instance of this in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
      "#fig5">5</a> (b), where we set <em>ρ<sub>R</sub></em> = 0.2
      and <em>ρ<sub>B</sub></em> = 0.5 for <em>F<sub>d</sub></em>
      (green) and <em>ρ<sub>R</sub></em> = <em>ρ<sub>B</sub></em> =
      <em>ρ</em> = 0.5 for the original <em>F</em> (orange). Note
      that the fixed point of <em>F<sub>d</sub></em> ,
      <em>α<sub>d</sub></em> is now larger than <em>r</em>, which
      shows that the accumulated wealth of the red nodes has
      surpassed the expectation (their fraction, <em>r</em>),
      effectively reversing the hierarchy between the red and the
      blue nodes.</p>
      <p>Thus, in alleviating the algorithmic glass ceiling effect,
      we propose that the homophily parameter <em>ρ</em> be
      accounted for in designing structure-based recommendation
      algorithms. In our case, given a network with labels, a
      majority-minority partition, and a recommendation model based
      on random walks, one can infer and use the value of
      <em>ρ</em> in counteracting the bias, i.e., conduct a random
      walk which ”accepts” with probability <em>ρ</em> a transition
      that leads to same label connection. This would be able to
      cancel the effect of homophily on the random walk and ought
      to equalize influence and power law coefficients among
      labels. It is not evident how to infer <em>ρ</em> from the
      dataset, as it is not simply equal to the observed fraction
      of mixed-label edges, since rejected edges are lost. However,
      as one can approximate the fraction of minority population
      <em>r</em> and the fraction of their total power, <em>α</em>,
      we can replace them as parameters in the function <em>F</em>
      from Lemma 4.3 from&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>], knowing that <em>F</em> has
      <em>α</em> as its fixed point. Thus, considering
      <em>F</em>(<em>α</em>) − <em>α</em> as a function of
      <em>ρ</em>, we know that it must be equal to 0 from the
      fixed-point equation, so we can solve for <em>ρ</em> and
      obtain an approximate value.</p>

      </header>
      <p>Our theoretical and empirical analysis unravel subtle
      dynamics of network growth, showing the way homophily and
      preferential attachment tie into the creation of a glass
      ceiling effect in a network that undergoes recommendations.
      We have thus formalized the algorithmic glass ceiling effect,
      and showed that while algorithms do not create disparity out
      of nowhere, they can worsen pre-existing inequality.</p>
      <p>Our empirical results reverse the hierarchy projected by
      the theoretical analysis in an unequal network in a
      surprising but not contradictory manner. Indeed, we show how
      a subtle mechanism of network growth, namely, differential
      homophily, can contribute in reversing the glass ceiling
      effect against the majority population. We hope these results
      will help future design of social recommendations that
      optimize relevance while preventing glass ceiling.</p>
