        <p><small>The surge in political information, discourse,
        and interaction has been one of the most important
        developments in social media over the past several years.
        There is rich structure in the interaction among different
        viewpoints on the ideological spectrum. However, we still
        have only a limited analytical vocabulary for expressing
        the ways in which these viewpoints interact.</small></p>
        <p><small>In this paper, we develop network-based methods
        that operate on the ways in which users share content; we
        construct <em>invocation graphs</em> on Web domains showing
        the extent to which pages from one domain are invoked by
        users to reply to posts containing pages from other
        domains. When we locate the domains on a political spectrum
        induced from the data, we obtain an embedded graph showing
        how these interaction links span different distances on the
        spectrum. The structure of this embedded network, and its
        evolution over time, helps us derive macro-level insights
        about how political interaction unfolded through 2016,
        leading up to the US Presidential election. In particular,
        we find that the domains invoked in replies spanned
        increasing distances on the spectrum over the months
        approaching the election, and that there was clear
        asymmetry between the left-to-right and right-to-left
        patterns of linkage.</small></p>

      <p>Political interaction has long constituted a key use of
      social media, and there is a correspondingly rich history of
      research into its structure — one that extends the much
      longer history of scholarship on the role of media in the
      political process [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>].</p>
      <p>A crucial issue in this line of work is the extent to
      which political interaction on social media takes place
      primarily among users who are ideologically similar, or
      whether it reaches across the political spectrum. Early
      analysis of political blogging indicated a clustered
      structure, with a high density of linkage among ideologically
      similar blogs and a lower density of linkage between blogs
      with strongly differing views [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. Subsequent work, looking at
      platforms that arose further into the evolution of social
      media, suggested that a more complex structure was
      developing, in which homophily in views remained a powerful
      force, but where the platforms were providing users with some
      level of cross-cutting exposure [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. These questions are important, as
      they ask whether online political interaction consists of
      opposing sides who engage with each other, or well-separated
      clusters who are isolated in “echo chambers” or “filter
      bubbles” [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>].</p>
      <p>The answers to such questions depend intrinsically on
      which types of interactions are being considered. Existing
      work in the online domain has implicitly focused on two
      standard forms of interaction: page-to-page interaction,
      expressed by hyperlinks among documents [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]; and user-to-user
      interaction, expressed by communication among people on
      social platforms [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>]. Each of these induces a network on a
      set of entities — sources and users respectively — which can
      then be analyzed relative to an underlying political
      spectrum.</p>
      <p><strong>Networks of sources invoked by users.</strong>.
      Here we consider a different type of political interaction
      network, defined as follows. When a user <em>u</em> shares a
      page <em>A</em>, and a user <em>v</em> replies by sharing a
      page <em>B</em>, there is not simply an interaction between
      users <em>u</em> and <em>v</em>; an interaction is also
      induced between pages <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. As reshares
      develop into a widespread style of social media content
      production [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>], the
      ability of users to deploy page references as proxies in
      their discussion becomes an activity requiring very low
      effort, and we find through a large-scale analysis of Twitter
      data leading up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election that
      such <em>A</em>-<em>B</em> interactions are widespread: users
      regularly invoke links in this back-and-forth fashion when
      they interact with each other.</p>
      <p>These <em>invoked interactions</em> between pages
      <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are fundamentally different from
      both user-to-user and page-to-page interaction networks.
      Unlike free-form user-to-user interactions, they create
      logical relationships among the information sources, not just
      the consumers and sharers of these sources. But they are not
      like traditional page-to-page interactions either, because
      they are not based on a hyperlink from <em>A</em> to
      <em>B</em>, and they are not in general determined by the
      authors of either <em>A</em> or <em>B</em>; it is the readers
      <em>deciding how <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> should be used in
      discussion</em> who are determining the logical link between
      them. In this sense, invoked interactions between <em>A</em>
      and <em>B</em> are not directly under the control of the
      authors of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>; they form a kind of
      “revealed interpretation” of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> once
      they are released into social media.</p>
      <p>The idea that replying to page <em>A</em> with page
      <em>B</em> can create a semantically meaningful connection
      between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> formed the basis of an
      elegant technique due to Frigerri, Adamic, Eckles, and Cheng
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] for
      identifying pages to debunk widely circulated rumors. Drawing
      on the fact that snopes.com is a heavily-used site for
      evaluating Internet rumors, they demonstrated that many
      instances of a pair (<em>B</em>, <em>A</em>), where
      <em>A</em> is a page appearing in Facebook posts and
      <em>B</em> is a page on snopes.com, serves as strong evidence
      that <em>B</em> is providing a judgment on the credibility of
      <em>A</em>. In this way, scanning the replies to posts where
      <em>A</em> occurs for pages residing on snopes.com provides
      an automated method for identifying a page <em>B</em> that
      can help users evaluate the veracity of <em>A</em>.</p>
      <p>Given that invoked interactions between pages <em>A</em>
      and <em>B</em> more generally are voluminous, transcending
      any one particular domain or use case, what do we learn if we
      consider the set of all such interactions as a network in its
      own right, latent in a social media platform?</p>
      <p><strong>The present work: The structure of invocation
      graphs.</strong>. We are interested in understanding the
      global structure of the network of invoked interactions, and
      developing methods that can probe this structure,
      particularly for questions related to political interaction.
      Because our primary focus in this work will be at the
      granularity of news and blogging <em>sources</em> rather than
      the individual pages they produce, we will consider this
      network at the level of domains: using a large Twitter
      dataset covering all of 2016 up to the U.S. Presidential
      election, we say that an <em>invoked interaction</em> from
      domain <em>B</em> to domain <em>A</em> occurs whenever a user
      replies to a tweet containing a page from domain <em>A</em>
      with a page from domain <em>B</em>.</p>
      <p>We define the <em>invocation graph</em> on a set of
      domains of interest as follows: for all pairs of domains
      <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> where there is at least one invoked
      interaction from <em>B</em> to <em>A</em>, we include a
      weighted directed edge (<em>B</em>, <em>A</em>) whose weight
      is equal to the number of such invoked interactions. Because
      we want to study how portions of the invocation graph reflect
      aspects of political interaction, we choose the node set
      (i.e. the domains of interest) using a preprocessing step
      that only includes domains that were extensively retweeted
      with the official Twitter accounts of Hillary Clinton and
      Donald Trump, and then apply some further filtering
      heuristics that we describe in the next section.</p>
      <p>After this filtering, we have an invocation graph that
      reflects the ways in which Twitter users interacted with one
      another by invoking content from different politically
      relevant domains over the course of 2016.
      Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> shows a few
      domains of such an invocation graph with some sample
      interactions from our data. We can see these interactions can
      be supportive, like an in-depth New York Times report on
      Russian information operations shared in reply to an article
      from The Guardian on the same subject, or adversarial, like a
      Breitbart article on the New York Times’ taxes shared in
      response to a Times article on Donald Trump's taxes. These
      replies exhibit rich structure and give a sense for how
      complex political interactions unfold on social media</p>
      <p>We can thus return to some of the initial motivating
      questions and ask how this interaction was structured
      relative to a political spectrum containing support for
      Clinton on the left and support for Trump on the right. We do
      this using a political spectrum induced from the data, rather
      than relying on external domain knowledge. There are a number
      of ways to do this [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>] that yield broadly consistent
      results, and we employ a method of Benkler et al (described
      further in the next section) that bases the spectrum on the
      relative frequency of co-tweets with the Clinton and Trump
      Twitter accounts [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>].</p>
      <p><strong>Embedding the Invocation Graph in a Political
      Spectrum.</strong>. Having thus located the domains on a
      political spectrum, we now have an <em>embedded</em> version
      of the invocation graph: the nodes, representing domains, are
      embedded in a one-dimensional spectrum, and the weighted
      directed edges span pairs of points in this spectrum. We can
      now ask how the edges are distributed across distances on the
      spectrum, ranging from short-range interactions that connect
      domains of similar political orientation to long-range
      interactions that reach across sides. In examining these
      questions, it is crucial to recall that these links among
      domains are not defined by hyperlinks in the content on these
      domains, but instead via the replies made by users when they
      invoke this content in discussions: it is not that the
      domains are replying to each other, but that they are being
      invoked in replies by users. The data thus reflects choices
      made by the consumers of the content, rather than by authors
      of the content.</p>
      <p>In Section 3, we propose a set of methods to analyze how
      the edges of the invocation graph span the underlying
      spectrum. A core component of these methods is, for a domain
      <em>x</em>, to consider its <em>out-link distribution</em> —
      the distribution of “landing points” on the political
      spectrum for all links out of <em>x</em>. As we move from
      left to right along the spectrum, tracking the out-link
      distributions of domains we encounter along the way, do the
      means of these distributions tend to move from left to right
      as well, or do they tend to move inversely from right to
      left? The former case would indicate a positive correlation
      in the locations of the source and target of an invoked
      interaction (<em>B</em>, <em>A</em>), suggesting links are
      used to connect to similar sides of the political spectrum;
      the latter case would correspond to a negative correlation
      and hence connections across the spectrum, with domains on
      the left being invoked to reply to domains on the right, and
      vice versa.</p>
      <p>It is not a priori obvious which type of correlation we
      should expect to see; and as a reinforcement of this fact, we
      find that the nature of the correlation actually inverts over
      the course of 2016 leading up to the U.S. Presidential
      election. In the early parts of 2016 we have a positive
      correlation, with politically similar domains being invoked
      to reply to each other; but by the time we reach the months
      directly preceding the election, this same correlation
      measure has become negative, indicating that most of the
      linking is now crossing the spectrum. We verify this effect
      using multiple measures, including one in which we compare
      the trends across the spectrum to what we'd observe in a
      <em>randomly rewired</em> version of the embedded graph.</p>
      <p>We also propose a set of methods to identify inherent
      <em>asymmetries</em> in the patterns of linkage: do replies
      from left to right have the same structure as replies from
      right to left? Using our measures, we find strong asymmetries
      in the 2016 Twitter data, with domains on the right side of
      the spectrum having a disproportionately high rate of
      out-links in the invocation graph and domains on the left
      side of the spectrum having a disproportionately high rate of
      in-links. This right-to-left flow in the replies persists
      across the entire time range, and is a key characteristic of
      the structure.</p>
      <p>Since a recurring theme in our analyses is the way in
      which replies increasingly engaged opposite sides of the
      political spectrum as 2016 went on, it is interesting to ask
      whether we see a similar effect in a more traditional
      user-to-user interaction graph, with nodes corresponding to
      users and directed edges to replies from one user to another.
      To explore this, we adapt the techniques developed for the
      invocation graph to a user-to-user graph built from Reddit.
      Specifically, we analyze a snapshot of Reddit's politics
      subreddit, <tt>r/politics</tt>, for the same period of 2016
      up to the election; we classify users by whether they had
      posted to the Clinton or Trump subreddits, and then look at
      the rate of replies among different types of users. We find
      that the trend on Reddit closely tracks the trend in the
      invocation graph built from Twitter, with increasing linkage
      between the two sides as the election approached.</p>
      <p>Overall, our methodology suggests that the invocation
      graph on domains, and its embedding into a one-dimensional
      spectrum, captures important aspects of political interaction
      on social media — the tendency of users to interact by
      invoking links to authored content, and the use of these
      interaction patterns to thus reveal relationships among the
      content based on usage in everyday discussion.</p>

      <p>We begin with a Twitter dataset containing aggregate-level
      information about tweet-reply pairs. For each month from
      January to November 2016 (the US Presidential election was
      held on November 8, 2016), the dataset consists of pairs of
      domains <em>x</em> <sub>1</sub> and <em>x</em> <sub>2</sub>
      along with an accompanying count, the number of times a tweet
      containing a page from domain <em>x</em> <sub>1</sub> was
      posted in reply to a tweet containing a page from domain
      <em>x</em> <sub>2</sub>. In addition, for each month, we have
      an auxiliary dataset of co-occurrences: for each domain
      <em>x</em>, the number of times a user posted a tweet
      containing a page from <em>x</em> on the same day that the
      user retweeted Hillary Clinton's or Donald Trump's personal
      Twitter account. Finally, we have the number of retweets of
      Clinton or Trump for each month.</p>
      <p>The invocation graph we construct from this data is a
      directed graph with domains as vertices, where each domain
      corresponds to a news source. We draw an edge <em>x</em>
      <sub>1</sub> → <em>x</em> <sub>2</sub> if a tweet containing
      a URL from domain <em>x</em> <sub>1</sub> is posted in reply
      to a tweet containing a URL from domain <em>x</em>
      <sub>2</sub>. The weight of this edge is the number of such
      tweet-reply pairs. On first inspection, the most prominent
      feature of this graph is that self-loops (consisting of links
      from a domain <em>x</em> to itself) have much higher weight
      than other edges. Since our goal is to examine political
      interactions between domains, we remove all self-loops from
      the graph.</p>
      <p><strong>Isolating Political Domains.</strong>. The first
      issue we encounter is that Twitter contains a wide range of
      URLs, not just pages from politically relevant domains. We
      could select only known political domains by whitelisting
      them, i.e. only considering the subgraph over a predefined
      set of domains; however, this approach will inevitably miss
      out on influential but less well-known news sources.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, there are challenges to a completely
      unsupervised approach. URLs on Twitter are dominated by
      social media sites (e.g. twitter.com, facebook.com) as well
      as content-hosting sites (e.g. imgur.com, bitly.com) which
      produce virtually no content of their own, but instead host
      user-uploaded content such as images, links, and text. While
      the usage of these content-hosting sites would be interesting
      to study, this is outside the scope of our work.</p>
      <p>We begin by blacklisting several known social media and
      content-hosting domains and remove them from the graph.
      However, there are plenty of domains that appear on Twitter
      that are not politically relevant, and we cannot individually
      remove each such domain. To filter out such domains, we need
      some measure of <em>political engagement</em> for each
      domain. We can construct such a measure by using the
      observation that politically relevant domains should
      frequently co-occur with known political entities – in our
      case, the official Twitter accounts of Hillary Clinton and
      Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Our measure of political engagement for a domain, then, is
      simply the number of times a user posted a tweet with that
      domain on the same day that he or she retweeted either
      Clinton's or Trump's official Twitter account. Intuitively,
      the more politically engaging a domain is, the more it will
      co-occur with these political entities. With this proxy, we
      can select domains with high political engagement, excluding
      social-media and content-hosting domains.</p>
      <p>As a final filter, we require that each domain have an
      edge of at weight least <em>W</em> to some other domain in
      the political subgraph. This restricts our attention to the
      most actively used political domains. Based on this, we can
      formally define the invocation graph. Every domain in the
      invocation graph</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="•">is not blacklisted (social media
        and content-hosting domains)<br /></li>
        <li id="list2" label="•">has political engagement above
        some threshold <em>p</em><br /></li>
        <li id="list3" label="•">has at least one edge to another
        domain in the invocation graph with weight at least
        <em>W</em><br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>We require the invocation graph be connected and contain
      some seed domain. Any choice of popular American news outlet
      would yield exactly the same result, as they all belong to
      the same connected component. (We use nytimes.com, but the
      choice is immaterial.)</p>
      <p>Based on this definition, the algorithm to construct the
      invocation graph is as follows: begin with the full graph,
      remove all nodes that are either blacklisted or have
      political engagement below <em>p</em>, and run a
      breadth-first search beginning at nytimes.com following only
      edges of weight at least <em>W</em>. In practice, we find
      that the values we use for <em>p</em> and <em>W</em> don't
      affect our results much, and all of the results presented
      here use <em>p</em> = 10000 and <em>W</em> = 100. Because we
      study the change in this invocation graph over time, we build
      a new graph <em>G<sup>m</sup></em> for each month <em>m</em>
      from January to November 2016.</p>
      <p><strong>A Political Spectrum.</strong>. In order to
      characterize the political nature of this graph, we need some
      way of organizing the domains along a political spectrum.
      Drawing on techniques from [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] and our definition of political
      engagement, we define the quantities <em>P<sub>T</sub></em>
      (<em>x</em>|<em>C</em>) and <em>P<sub>T</sub></em>
      (<em>x</em>|<em>T</em>) for each domain <em>x</em> as the
      empirical probabilities that a user posted a tweet containing
      a URL from domain <em>x</em> given that, on the same day,
      he/she retweeted Clinton's or Trump's official account
      respectively. Intuitively, if a user has retweeted Clinton on
      a given day, the domains that he/she invokes are more likely
      to be on Clinton's end of the political spectrum, and the
      same is true for Trump. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
      "#fig2">2</a> shows the resulting values, where the blue line
      is <em>P<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>|<em>C</em>) =
      <em>P<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>|<em>T</em>).
      Interestingly, most domains lie above this line, suggesting a
      difference in the populations of users retweeting Clinton and
      Trump respectively.</p>

      </figure>
      <p></p>
      <p>Furthermore, we can condense this information into a
      single <em>political score</em> for each domain:</p>

        <div class="display-equation">

      and the larger <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>) is, the
      closer <em>x</em> is to the Trump end of the spectrum.

      January-September 2016.

      <p>With these definitions, we can analyze various properties
      of the invocation graph, and in particular, its interaction
      with the political spectrum. Do usage patterns of news
      articles and other political content differ across the
      political spectrum? How do these patterns change leading up
      to the election? Using the invocation graph in tandem with
      the political spectrum, we can shed light on these
      questions.</p>
      <p><strong>Out-link Distributions.</strong>. A key
      characteristic we study is the <em>out-link distribution</em>
      for a domain <em>x</em>: the distribution of positions on the
      political spectrum where edges originating from <em>x</em>
      land. A domain's out-links describe the way in which it is
      used to reply to other domains. For example, if a domain has
      many out-links to other domains near it on the political
      spectrum, one might expect that it is being used to reinforce
      a particular point of view; however, if it has many out-links
      to the opposite end of the spectrum, it may instead be used
      to disagree or argue with an opposing viewpoint.</p>
      <p>To draw upon this intuition, we ask how <em>x</em>’s
      out-link distribution varies based on its political score
      <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>). As a baseline for
      comparison, we compute the <em>global</em> out-link
      distribution — the distribution over the political spectrum
      of where edges in <em>G</em> land. Comparing to this baseline
      will give us some insight as to how <em>x</em>’s linking
      pattern differs from the “average” linking pattern.</p>
      <p>However, since <em>G</em> contains no self-loops,
      <em>x</em> doesn't link to itself, while the global out-link
      distribution contains links to <em>x</em>. To prevent this
      from biasing the comparison, we instead compare <em>x</em>’s
      out-link distribution to the out-link distribution of
      <em>G</em>\<em>x</em>, that is, <em>G</em> with <em>x</em>
      and all edges into or out of <em>x</em> removed.</p>
      <p>Thus, <em>x</em>’s out-link distribution distribution
      <em>d</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>G</em>) is a distribution over [0,
      1] assigning probability mass to <em>y</em> ∈ [0, 1]
      proportional to the weight of edges from <em>x</em> to
      <em>x</em>′ such that <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>′) =
      <em>y</em>. The global out-link distribution
      <em>D</em>(<em>G</em>\<em>x</em>) can then be expressed
      as</p>
      <div class="table-responsive">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\[ D(G \backslash x) = \frac{\sum
          _{x^{\prime } \in G \backslash x} d(x^{\prime }, G
          \backslash x) \cdot \operatorname{vol}(x^{\prime }, G
          \backslash x)}{\sum _{x^{\prime } \in G \backslash x}
          \operatorname{vol}(x^{\prime }, G \backslash x)},
          \]</span><br />
        </div>
      </div>where <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$\operatorname{vol}(x^{\prime }, G \backslash
      x)$</span></span> is the total weight of edges leaving
      <em>x</em>′ in <em>G</em>\<em>x</em>. In other words,
      <em>D</em>(<em>G</em>\<em>x</em>) is the weighted average of
      <em>d</em>(<em>x</em>′, <em>G</em>\<em>x</em>) for
      <em>x</em>′ ∈ <em>G</em>\<em>x</em>.
      <p></p>
      <p>We make the comparison between these distributions formal
      as follows: for each <em>x</em>, let <em>μ</em>
      <sub>out</sub>(<em>x</em>) be the weighted average political
      score of the domains that <em>x</em> links to, so that
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mu
      _{\text{out}}(x) = \mathbb {E} \left[ d(x, G)
      \right]$</span></span> . This gives an estimate of what types
      of domains <em>x</em> is used to reply to — if <em>μ</em>
      <sub>out</sub>(<em>x</em>) is close to 0, then <em>x</em> is
      used primarily to reply to Clinton-related domains, while if
      it is close to 1, then <em>x</em> is used primarily to reply
      to Trump-related domains. In a slight abuse of notation, let
      <em>μ</em> <sub>out</sub>(<em>G</em>\<em>x</em>) be the
      weighted average political score of all endpoints of edges in
      <em>G</em>\<em>x</em>, so <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mu _{\text{out}}(G
      \backslash x) = \mathbb {E} \left[ D(G \backslash x)
      \right]$</span></span> . Then,</p>
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq2">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} \delta
          _{\text{out}}(x) = \mu _{\text{out}}(x) - \mu

        </div>
      </div>is a measure of how much <em>x</em> deviates from other
      domains towards the Trump end of the political spectrum.
      <p></p>
      <p>From past work documenting <em>homophily</em> in online
      political activity&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>], one might expect that a domain will
      be used primarily to engage with politically similar domains,
      implying that <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>) is
      positively correlated with <em>δ</em>
      <sub>out</sub>(<em>x</em>). Furthermore, it is not a priori
      obvious whether this trend should become more or less
      pronounced leading up to the election — do the opposing
      parties increasingly converse within themselves, or do they
      engage with one another?</p>
      <p>Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> shows that
      in January, domains are more likely to have links in the
      graph to politically similar domains, so
      <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>) and <em>δ</em>
      <sub>out</sub>(<em>x</em>) are positively correlated.
      However, by October, this correlation has reversed: on
      average, domains are being used to reply <em>across</em> the
      political spectrum instead of to politically similar domains.
      Replies seem to be adversarial, as with the breitbart.com →
      nytimes.com edge in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
      "#fig1">1</a>.</p>
      <p>To understand this change in correlation over time, we
      define <em>a</em>(<em>G<sup>m</sup></em> ) to be the slope of
      the correlation between <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>)
      and <em>δ</em> <sub>out</sub>(<em>x</em>) for month
      <em>m</em>. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>
      shows that <em>a</em>(<em>G<sup>m</sup></em> ) decreases
      significantly from January to October 2016. This suggests
      that as the election drew nearer, the fraction of interaction
      between opposite ends of the spectrum increased, and domains
      from the two opposing sides were actually being invoked more
      often to reply to each other.</p>

      <p><strong>Edge Lengths and Crossing Points.</strong>.
      Another way of characterizing the political aspects of the
      invocation graph is to consider the lengths and locations of
      the edges on the political spectrum. As the interaction
      between opposing viewpoints increases, we expect to see
      longer edges in the invocation graph that cross the political
      spectrum instead of staying on one side.
      Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a> shows that this
      trend holds true between January and October — while most
      links had length close to 0 in with respect to the political
      spectrum in January, by October, many longer edges were
      present.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>To enable us to visualize where on the spectrum edges lie,
      we make the following definitions. For a point <em>y</em> ∈
      [0, 1], let <em>f</em> <sub>→</sub>(<em>y</em>, <em>G</em>)
      be the number of edges (<em>x</em> <sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em>
      <sub>2</sub>) such that <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>
      <sub>1</sub>) &lt; <em>y</em> &lt; <em>s<sub>T</sub></em>
      (<em>x</em> <sub>2</sub>). Similarly, let <em>f</em>
      <sub>←</sub>(<em>y</em>, <em>G</em>) be the number of edges
      such that <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em> <sub>1</sub>)
      &gt; <em>y</em> &gt; <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>
      <sub>2</sub>). In other words, <em>f</em>
      <sub>→</sub>(<em>y</em>, <em>G</em>) is the number of edges
      crossing <em>y</em> from left to right on the political
      spectrum, and <em>f</em> <sub>←</sub>(<em>y</em>, <em>G</em>)
      is the number of edges crossing <em>y</em> from right to
      left.</p>

        </div>
      </figure>
      <p></p>
      <p>In order to interpret these functions, we need a baseline
      to compare against. A natural baseline in such scenarios is
      the <em>randomly rewired</em> graph <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\hat{G}$</span></span> ,
      the idea of which goes back to&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>]. In <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\hat{G}$</span></span> ,
      every vertex has the same indegree and outdegree as in
      <em>G</em>, but each edge has a randomly chosen endpoint.
      Note that this can create self-loops, which <em>G</em> does
      not have by construction; however, the number of self-loops
      in <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$\hat{G}$</span></span> is small (often 0 for a given
      randomization) and therefore their effect on this analysis is
      negligible. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>
      shows <em>f</em> <sub>→</sub> and <em>f</em> <sub>←</sub> for
      <em>G</em> and <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

      <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$\hat{G}$</span></span> are in expectation. In January,
      both <em>f</em> <sub>→</sub> and <em>f</em> <sub>←</sub> are
      dominated by their rewired counterparts, while in October,
      the opposite is true. This suggests that at the beginning of
      the year, domains were used to reply to politically similar
      domains, resulting in shorter edges than a random baseline,
      while closer to the election, domains were used to reply
      across the political spectrum. This comparison allows us to
      get a sense for how actual behavior deviates from random
      behavior, and how this deviation changes over time.</p>
      <p><strong>Asymmetry in Out-links.</strong>. Another striking
      feature of Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a> is
      that <em>f</em> <sub>←</sub> dominates <em>f</em>
      <sub>→</sub>, showing that many more links crossed
      right-to-left than left-to-right. Intuitively, it seems that
      a disproportionate number of edges originate on the right and
      end on the left, corresponding to right-leaning domains being
      used to reply to left-leaning domains. We can make this
      precise by defining <em>r</em>(<em>x</em>) as the ratio of
      indegree(<em>x</em>)/(indegree(<em>x</em>) +
      outdegree(<em>x</em>)) and analyzing how
      <em>r</em>(<em>x</em>) changes with <em>s<sub>T</sub></em>
      (<em>x</em>). Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a>
      shows that <em>r</em>(<em>x</em>) is negatively correlated
      with <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>), meaning that
      domains on the right end of the political spectrum produce a
      disproportionate number of out-links compared to domains on
      the left end. In other words, domains on the right are more
      often used to reply to other domains, while domains on the
      left are more often the recipients of replies.</p>

      <p>Having established a set of results for the structure of
      invocation graphs on Twitter, we would like to verify that
      our findings are qualitatively consistent with what we see in
      more traditional user-to-user communication graphs on social
      media. Since our Twitter dataset doesn't contain information
      about individual users, we instead turn to a publicly
      available Reddit dataset<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Reddit is a community discussion
      website organized into posts, or “submissions,” and comments
      on those submissions. Comments are threaded, so that a
      comment is either in reply to a top-level post or to another
      comment. The data consists of every post and comment from
      Reddit in 2016, along with its author's username. Reddit is
      subdivided into forums for particular topics called
      <em>subreddits</em>. We focus on three subreddits in
      particular: <tt>r/politics</tt>, <tt>r/hillaryclinton</tt>,
      and <tt>r/The_Donald</tt>, which are devoted to politics,
      Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump respectively. All three
      subreddits were among the most active subreddits during 2016.
      Note that in addition to studying user-to-user dynamics on
      Reddit, in principle we could also use Reddit data to
      replicate our Twitter invocation-graph analysis at the domain
      level; however, it turns out that Reddit contains too few
      comments with URLs for robust domain-level trends to
      emerge.</p>
      <p><strong>Interactions at the User Level.</strong>. In order
      to test for analogous trends at the user level to those we
      found at the domain level, we need to modify our methods. In
      particular, we now need some kind of political information
      about users. Whereas in Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-5">2</a> we anchored the political spectrum to the
      official Clinton and Trump Twitter accounts, here we anchor
      our notion of political affiliations to
      <tt>r/hillaryclinton</tt> and <tt>r/The_Donald</tt>. Since
      most users are active in at most one of the two subreddits,
      we have a simpler notion of a political score: we define a
      set <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> of users who posted in
      <tt>r/hillaryclinton</tt> but not <tt>r/The_Donald</tt>, and
      we define a set <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> of users who posted in
      <tt>r/The_Donald</tt> but not <tt>r/hillaryclinton</tt>.
      There are 22,164 users in <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> and 281,334
      users in <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> (more than ten times the size
      of <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> ). We assume that most users in
      <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> are pro-Clinton, while most users in
      <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> are pro-Trump (this is consistent with
      the explicit ground rules for participating in these
      subreddits).</p>
      <p><strong>Validating Political Information from
      Subreddits.</strong>. We verify that
      <tt>r/hillaryclinton</tt> and <tt>r/The_Donald</tt> contain
      strong signal about political orientation by adapting our
      methodology from Twitter to build a spectrum over the domains
      on Reddit, and then comparing this spectrum to the one built
      from Twitter. To do this, we define <em>P<sub>R</sub></em>
      (<em>x</em>|<em>C</em>) to be the empirical probability that
      a post or comment in <tt>r/hillaryclinton</tt> contains a URL
      from domain <em>x</em> (and analogously for
      <em>P<sub>R</sub></em> (<em>x</em>|<em>T</em>) and
      <tt>r/The_Donald</tt>). As in&nbsp;(<a class="eqn" href=
      "#eq1">1</a>), we can define a political score from Reddit
      as</p>
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq3">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} s_R(x) =
          \frac{P_R(x|T)}{P_R(x|C)+ P_R(x|T)}.
          \end{equation}</span><br />
          <span class="equation-number">(3)</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <p>Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> shows the
      orderings of the Twitter and Reddit spectra for 21 domains.
      The Spearman rank correlation&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>] (a measure of squared
      distance) between the two orderings is 0.871 (compared to a
      maximum of 0.757 over 10,000 randomly shuffled orderings).
      Thus the two settings align well, demonstrating that our
      notion of political affiliation is adaptable to Reddit, and
      that it contains strong and consistent signal.</p>

      <p><strong>Building a User-to-User Graph on Reddit.</strong>.
      With this notion of political affiliation, we can now
      investigate some basic properties of political discourse on
      Reddit. Just as we first restricted our attention to
      political domains on Twitter, here we restrict our attention
      to the main political subreddit <tt>r/politics</tt>. Since
      only a subset of the users in <tt>r/politics</tt> are in
      either <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> or <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> , we
      focus on comment-reply pairs in which both users involved are
      in one of <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> or <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> .
      There are 4 possible types of interaction:
      <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> → <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> ,
      <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> → <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> ,
      <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> → <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> , and
      <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> → <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> where
      <em>p</em> → <em>q</em> means that a user from <em>p</em>
      posts a reply to a comment from a user in <em>q</em>. Let
      <em>n</em> <sub><em>p</em> → <em>q</em></sub> be the number
      of <em>p</em> → <em>q</em> interactions in a given time
      period. We organize the data into sliding windows of 30 days.
      In the following plots, the value at a particular date
      represents the 30-day window ending at that date.
      Figure&nbsp;8a shows comment counts throughout 2016 averaged
      over the next 30 days, and Figure&nbsp;8b shows what fraction
      of the comments were each type of interaction.</p>
      <figure id="fig8">

          In Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig8">8c</a>, a

          <em>C</em></sub> + <em>n</em> <sub><em>T</em> →

          <em>T</em></sub> + <em>n</em> <sub><em>T</em> →
          <em>C</em></sub> ) shows more interaction reaching across
          the spectrum.</span>
        </div>
      </figure>
      <p></p>
      <p>Figure&nbsp;8b shows that a steadily rising number of
      comments are cross-cutting (e.g., are of types
      <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> → <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> and
      <em>U<sub>T</sub></em> → <em>U<sub>C</sub></em> ) from the
      beginning of 2016 up until the election in early November,
      followed by a return to a baseline rate.
      Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig8">8c</a> further
      reinforces this point, showing a strong negative slope in the
      ratio of edges between users of the same political leaning
      and users of different political leanings from January until
      the November 8 election. These results are consistent with
      our findings our Twitter, where an increasing fraction of
      political interactions reach across the political spectrum on
      Twitter up until the election.</p>
      <p>To interpret the significance of these results, we adapt
      our random rewiring technique to the user level by randomly
      reassigning users to comments, preserving the invariant that
      each user still posts the same number of comments as in the
      original data. Whether we randomize globally (a comment is
      randomly attributed to any user from all of 2016) or each
      month (a comment is attributed to a randomly chosen user from
      the same month that comment was written), the results are the
      same – the observed slope is significantly more negative than
      the minimum over 100 random trials.</p>
      <p>Using our Reddit dataset, we've shown that our invocation
      graph methodology can be adapted to analyze traditional
      user-user communication graphs. In particular, we've used
      co-occurrences to determine political information about both
      users and domains. The month-to-month trend found at the user
      level mirrors our findings on Twitter — in the months leading
      up to the election, online political interaction increasingly
      reached across the political spectrum.</p>

      <p>Our formulation of the political spectrum in this work
      indicates that it has a natural <em>two-dimensional</em>
      structure, with one dimension corresponding to co-occurrence
      probabilities with content related to one candidate, and the
      other dimension corresponding to co-occurrence probabilities
      with content related to the other candidate.</p>
      <p>In Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-7">4</a>, when
      we established that our invocation graph methodology extends
      naturally to the traditional user-level setting, part of our
      analysis involved measuring how well the one-dimensional
      spectra <em>s<sub>T</sub></em> (·) and <em>s<sub>R</sub></em>
      (·) shown in Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a>
      align. Here we consider how to measure the alignment of the
      corresponding two-dimensional spectra.</p>
      <p>To make this comparison, we need to account for the fact
      that axes may have different scales (e.g. posts on Reddit
      contain URLs at a different rate than on Twitter). This means
      we need to scale <em>P<sub>R</sub></em>
      (<em>x</em>|<em>C</em>) and <em>P<sub>R</sub></em>
      (<em>x</em>|<em>T</em>) in order to find the “best match”
      between the two spectra. We formalize this as the following
      optimization problem, minimizing the squared ℓ<sub>2</sub>
      distance of each pair of points:</p>
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq4">
        <div class="display-equation">

      <p>We can also use this same alignment technique to compare
      spectra between months. Figures&nbsp;10a and&nbsp;10b show
      that in absolute terms, the spectra produced by January and
      February on Twitter look quite different. In fact, after
      scaling the axes, the spectra align very well
      (Figure&nbsp;10c, using ℓ<sub>1</sub>-minimization). One way
      to see this is to compare the quality of alignment in our
      data the quality of alignment among shuffled versions of the
      spectra for January and February, where the domains labeling
      the points are randomly permuted; we find that the alignment
      for the real data has much lower cost than the typical
      alignment for shuffled data. The disparity between the
      unscaled spectra seems to indicate an influx of users in
      February who retweeted Clinton but didn't necessarily engage
      in other sorts of political activity; this left the relative
      position of other domains in the two-dimensional spectrum
      unaffected.</p>
      <p>We also note this type of scaling doesn't affect the
      one-dimensional orderings in Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
      "#tab1">1</a>. We can rewrite the political score as
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$s_T(x) =
      \frac{1}{1 + \tan \theta _T}$</span></span> , where
      <em>θ<sub>T</sub></em> is the angle of <em>x</em> from the
      <em>P<sub>T</sub></em> (<em>x</em>|<em>C</em>) axis. Since
      scaling the axes preserves the ordering of these angles, it
      also preserves the one-dimensional rankings.</p>

      <p>With access to information now abundant, a growing line of
      work has investigated how this impacts consumption of
      political information. As mentioned in the introduction, a
      key issue has been measuring the extent to which online

      it stays relatively confined in “filter bubbles” or “echo

          <h2><span class="section-number">7</span> Conclusion</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In this work we have introduced <em>invocation
      graphs</em>, together with a set of techniques for analyzing
      them, as a means of probing the structure of online political
      interaction. In combination with previous methods for
      inducing a political spectrum from data, we develop methods
      for measuring several important phenomena. In particular, we
      analyzed a natural embedding of the invocation graph in the
      political spectrum, and asked how its edges are distributed
      across this spectrum—whether they are sequestered in
      ideological pockets or whether they span larger ideological
      distances. Applying these techniques to political interaction
      on Twitter in the months leading up to the 2016 US
      Presidential election, we observed that political interaction
      via the invocation graph became increasingly cross-cutting as
      the election neared. We also developed methods to analyze
      whether there are inherent asymmetries between how the right
      and the left engage each other via replies. Applying our
      techniques to Twitter, we found that edges in in the
      invocation graph more consistently went from sources on the
      right to sources on the left than in the other direction.</p>
      <p>It is worth emphasizing a critical feature of invocation
      graphs, which is that they are composed of <em>invoked
      interactions</em> as opposed to direct interactions. Although
      on a surface level invocation graphs may resemble the
      hyperlink graphs that form a basic staple of Web analysis,
      they are actually quite different, as the links are generally
      not under the nodes’ control. News sources publish content,
      and then it is up to the readership to determine how these
      sources connect to each other in the invocation graph. In
      this sense, relative positions and functions of news domains
      in invocation graphs are indicative of how the public
      actually uses them in online political discussion. Beyond the
      ideological territory news sources may try to explicitly
      claim for themselves, invocation graphs position these
      sources according to their roles in political
      interaction.</p>
      <p>There are a number of important directions that remain to
      be pursued. First, it is intriguing to see how interaction
      both in the invocation graph on Twitter and the user-to-user
      interaction graph on Reddit became more and more
      ideologically cross-cutting as the election approached, given
      that homophily would suggest that most links should link to
      nearby points on the spectrum. Is there a systematic way to
      relate this trend to an underlying level of polarization, so
      that changes in the structure of the embedded invocation
      graph might provide insight into polarization and how it
      evolves? Second, beyond the two large social media datasets
      we considered, it would be illuminating to apply our methods
      in other settings as well. In particular, does online debate
      increasingly cross ideological divides in the run-up to
      milestone events in general, or was this specific to the 2016
      US Presidential election? In general, we believe that
      applying and extending our methods for online political
      interaction using invocation graphs contains many promising
      directions for future work.</p>
