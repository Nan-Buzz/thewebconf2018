Particularly image classification models have seen advances with the first system claiming &#x201C;superhuman visual pattern recognition&#x201D; in a restricted and controlled setting back in 2011 [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. More recent trends have explored how knowledge bases can be utilized together with machine learning. For instance, a combined word embedding of the ConceptNet knowledge graph and the two popular word embeddings, word2vec and GloVe, could produce state-of-the-art results on word similarity tests [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>], while the Wembedder system uses an embedding of the Wikidata knowledge graph in a web application with recommender system features [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>].</p>    <p>To take advantage of knowledge graphs in machine learning we should deep-link systems, and preferably not just on the word-level but on a semantic level where the different senses of polysemic words are distinguished. One opportunity is a linkage between ImageNet through Wordnet to Wikidata. Below I will describe these three resources and follow with a detailed account of issues around on-going work on matching the items across these resources. I will show statistics and describe a small machine learning application that uses the linkage between ImageNet and Wikidata, and lastly discuss issues concerning the matching and the opportunities for extending Wikidata.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-3">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> WordNet, ImageNet and Wikidata</h2>    </div>    </header>    <section id="sec-4">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.1</span> WordNet</h3>     </div>    </header>    <p>WordNet is a machine readable lexical resource that describe words. Words that are synonyms are grouped into items called <em>synsets</em> [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. Each WordNet synset is associated with an Semantic Web Linked Open Data (LOD) URI. URIs for WordNet for version 3.0 has been prefixed with <a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn30/">http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn30/</a> while URIs for version 3.1 synsets are prefixed with <a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn31/">http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn31/</a>. The canonical prefix has been change recently, so the part <tt>wn30</tt> has been changed to <tt>pwn30</tt>.<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>    </p>    </section>    <section id="sec-5">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.2</span> ImageNet</h3>     </div>    </header>    <p>ImageNet [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] is a large collection of images, labeled against WordNet 3.0 and described at <a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://image-net.org/">http://image-net.org/</a>. According to January statistics, ImageNet contains 14,197,122 images and 21,841 indexed synsets. There are various labeling schemes. The object attributes scheme labels 400 synsets across 25 attributes. The attributes are with respect to color, pattern, shape and texture.<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge ILSVRC [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] is an image recognition challenge that started in 2010 and has been repeated for several years. It has had several tasks: image classification, single-object locatization or object detection. For the image classification task a subset with 1,000 object categories from ImageNet was selected corresponding to 1,000 WordNet synsets. ILSVRC synsets have changed through the years so only 639 have been used in all the years.</p>    <p>Inspired by the demonstration of the so-called AlexNet [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] where state-of-the-art image classification results were reported on the ILSVRC dataset, many publications describe the usage of the ILSVRC data for training deep learning image classification models. Researchers distribute pre-trained deep learning models based on the ILSVRC data. One such model is Resnet-50 described by [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]. High-level deep learning Python frameworks, Keras and Caffe, are able to read this model in a few lines of code. For instance, with Keras the pre-trained Resnet-50 model is set up with <tt>model&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;ResNet50()</tt>.<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> The Keras implementation will also convert the output of the trained model from its index-based value to the WordNet synset identifier.</p>    <p>In ImageNet the synset identifier is represented with the word class as a prefix, e.g., the synset identifier for banana is n07753592. So a (trivial) conversion is necessary to match the LOD URIs which in the banana case would be <a class="link-inline force-break"      href="http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn30/07753592-n">http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn30/07753592-n</a>, while a preview of corresponding ImageNet images is available as <a class="link-inline force-break"      href="http://image-net.org/explore.php?wnid=n07753592">http://image-net.org/explore.php?wnid=n07753592</a>. </p>    </section>    <section id="sec-6">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.3</span> Wikidata</h3>     </div>    </header>    <p>The collaborative knowledge graph, Wikidata, at <a class="link-inline force-break" href="https://www.wikidata.org">https://www.wikidata.org</a> [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] has over 40 million items (with the identifier prefixed with &#x201C;Q&#x201D;), that each may be described by several thousand properties (prefixed with &#x201C;P&#x201D;). Wikidata properties with the data type &#x201C;External identifier&#x201D; is often suggested as a means to deep linking external databases. Such a method could also be applied for WordNet synset identifiers. This requires a property suggestion and some deliberation among the Wikidata editor before the external identifier property is made available for use.<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id="foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> There is another way to link Wikidata with WordNet. Wikidata has a property to link to LOD URIs: the &#x201C;exact match&#x201D; property (P2888), corresponding to skos:exactMatch. This method can be used to link a Wikidata item to its associated WordNet synset, e.g., <em>mashed potato</em> (Q322787) is linked via the P2888 property to <a class="link-inline force-break"      href="http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn30/07711569-n">http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn30/07711569-n</a>. </p>    <p>Wikidata links to another lexical resource: The multilingual BabelNet<a class="fn" href="#fn5" id="foot-fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> is linked via its own external identifier property, the P2581<a class="fn" href="#fn6" id="foot-fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> which currently is used 59.105 times.<a class="fn" href="#fn7" id="foot-fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> While WordNet is one of the resources that uses BabelNet [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>], the identifier is different. For instance, &#x201C;quill pen&#x201D; is <a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://00065709n">00065709n</a> in BabelNet and 04033901-n in WordNet 3.0.</p>    <p>Once WordNet 3.0 URIs have been entered into Wikidata, we can obtain the inverse mapping from the WordNet URI to the Wikidata item with the Wikidata Query Service (WDQS) SPARQL engine, e.g., the SPARQL query &#x201C;<tt>SELECT * WHERE { ?item wdt:P2888 <http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn30/04033901-n> }</tt>&#x201D; will identify <a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://Q4063215">Q4063215</a> as the Wikidata item corresponding to the WordNet concept &#x201C;quill&#x201D;.</p>    <p>One advantage with Wikidata is its multilingual nature: Once we have linked a WordNet synset to a Wikidata item we can record labels in multiple languages, and in many cases the labels are already present. For instance, &#x201C;quill pen&#x201D; is currently labeled for 33 languages. The corresponding number for BabelNet is 12. It is important to note though that the multilinguality in Wikidata is certainly not complete and biased towards the major European languages [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>].</p>    <p>Wikidata and WordNet have been defined mostly independent of each other. There are other linked semantic resources where this is also the case. Examples are some of the wordnets inspired by the original English (Princeton) WordNet [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>].</p>    <div class="table-responsive" id="tab1">     <div class="table-caption">      <span class="table-number">Table 1:</span>      <span class="table-title">Matching between ImageNet, WordNet and Wikidata.

Matching Wikidata with ImageNet is for some concepts straightforward. For instance, many taxons can readily be matched. At other times the matching requires some thought. Table&#x00A0;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> shows examples where a match is particular difficult. Below I attempt a classification of various matching problems faced during manual linking of Wikidata items to WordNet synsets.</p>    <p>An ILSVRC synset is <strong>missing from Wikidata</strong>. In most of these cases, it is easy to create new Wikidata items and link them to WordNet. Examples where I could not find matching items and created new items are <em>soup bowl</em> and <em>bath towel</em>.</p>    <p>The matching Wikidata item is a Wikipedia <strong>disambiguation page</strong>: An example is car mirror where the English Wikipedia page &#x201C;Car mirror&#x201D; currently is a disambiguation page linking to two real articles &#x201C;Rear-view mirror&#x201D; and &#x201C;Wing mirror&#x201D;. A solution to such a problem would be to either create a new Wikidata item for car mirror or change the definition of &#x201C;Car mirror&#x201D; in both Wikidata and the English Wikipedia. &#x201C;Armchair is a disambiguation page in the English Wikipedia, but another item link armchair in Wikidata (<a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://Q25503439">Q25503439</a>). <em>Mixing bowl</em> is another example where the Wikidata item is describing a disambiguation page.</p>    <p>There is a <strong>discrepancy between ImageNet and WordNet</strong>: For instance, <em>sunglass</em> (<a class="link-inline force-break"     href="http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn30/04355933-n">http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn30/04355933-n</a>) is described as a &#x201C;a convex lens that focuses the rays of the sun; used to start a fire&#x201D;. However, the associated ImageNet images are better described with the <a class="link-inline force-break"     href="http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn31/104296228-n">http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn31/104296228-n</a> synset (dark glasses, shades, sunglasses) described with &#x201C;spectacles that are darkened or polarized to protect the eyes from the glare of the sun&#x201D;. This issue was previously noted by Tom White on Twitter in September 2017.<a class="fn" href="#fn8" id="foot-fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> In the same context he also reported differences between the <em>sunglass</em> and the <em>sunglasses</em> images. A similar confusion occurs for <em>maillot</em>, where Wordnet has two synsets: &#x201C;a woman&#x0027;s one-piece bathing suit&#x201D; and &#x201C;tights for dancers or gymnasts&#x201D;. For the latter synset, ImageNet displays images for one-piece bathing suits. Another example is <em>monitor</em> described as &#x201C;Electronic equipment that is used to check the quality or content of electronic transmissions&#x201D;. At ImageNet&#x0027;s <a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://n03782006">n03782006</a>, the images shown are broader with many displaying computer monitors, &#x2014; in Wikidata it would correspond to approximately the more general concept <a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://Q6021804">Q6021804</a> (&#x201C;electronic visual display&#x201D;). Related to the <em>monitor</em> issue is <em>screen</em> with the alias <em>CRT screen</em> and description &#x201C;The display that is electronically created on the surface of the large end of a cathode-ray tube&#x201D;. The associated ImageNet images show many screens that are not CRT-based, but flat panel displays. One interesting discrepancy is for <em>spider web</em>: WordNet has two synsets for that word: &#x201C;a web spun by spiders to trap insect prey&#x201D; and &#x201C;a web resembling the webs spun by spiders&#x201D; where the latter is regarded as an artifact and the former is not found in ImageNet. ImageNet images labeled with the latter sense (<a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://n04275548">n04275548</a>) show real natural spider webs. It is obvious that webs spun by spiders resemble webs spun by spiders, but in this case the webs spun by spiders should probably not be assigned to the WordNet synset. Table&#x00A0;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> shows other examples of this problem, e.g., for <em>cup</em> (coffee cup or punch), <em>menu</em> (printed list or a set of servings), <em>notebook</em> (computer or paper book for notes) and <em>pinwheel</em>. Not shown in the table is <em>picture rail</em> (&#x201C;rail fixed to a wall for hanging pictures&#x201D;) and its parent <em>rail</em> (&#x201C;a horizontal bar (usually of wood or metal)&#x201D;). For both these synsets ImageNet associates images of railways and trains. These cases may involve concepts with a large semantic difference. There are likely more discrepancies.</p>    <p>There are some <strong>difference between the WordNet and the Wikidata concepts with similar names</strong>. For instance, WordNet defines <em>street sign</em> as &#x201C;a sign visible from the street&#x201D; while Wikidata describes the same English word as a &#x201C;type of traffic sign used to identify named roads&#x201D; (<a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://Q1969455">Q1969455</a>). The Wikidata item for traffic sign (<a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://Q170285">Q170285</a>) is described as a &#x201C;symbol for people out in traffic&#x201D; corresponding better to the <em>street sign</em> of WordNet. Another example is &#x201C;tea chest&#x201D; that in the English Wikipedia (the only Wikipedia describing the concept) is explained as a case &#x201C;approximate size 500x500x750 millimeters&#x201D; with metal edges. Wikidata links this concept to the identifier 300039143 of the <em>Art &#x0026; Architecture Thesaurus</em> where it is explained as &#x201C;Square wooden cases usually fixed with sheet lead or tin and used for exporting tea.&#x201D; The English Wikipedia further extends the concept with &#x201C;The term is now used more widely to indicate similarly-sized cases, including cardboard cases, produced for various home and commercial uses.&#x201D; In ImageNet <em>tea chest</em> (n04397168) are cases with tea of varying sizes corresponding well to the WordNet&#x0027;s general description: &#x201C;Chest for storing or transporting tea&#x201D;. Here we have an example of the English Wikipedia describing two concepts in the same article, a specific and a general, where the general topic correspond to WordNet and ImageNet concepts.</p>    <p>There are a number of other cases where the matching requires an effort to resolve. These may involve <strong>multiple semantically similar items in WordNet and Wikidata</strong>: For instance, there are multiple synsets for <em>radiator</em>. The <em>radiator</em> synsets in ILSVRC (<a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://n04040759">n04040759</a>) is described as &#x201C;A mechanism consisting of a metal honeycomb through which hot fluids circulate; heat is transferred from the fluid through the honeycomb to the airstream that is created either by the motion of the vehicle or by a fan&#x201D;. Most of the ImageNet images associated with this synset fit the description of another synset described as a &#x201C;heater consisting of a series of pipes for circulating steam or hot water to heat rooms or buildings&#x201D;. In Wikidata there are 3 or 4 items close in semantics to <em>radiator</em>. WordNet distinguishes between <em>tape player</em>, (<a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://n04392985">n04392985</a>) and <em>tape recorder</em> (<a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://n04393095">n04393095</a>). In Wikidata there is only one item. Wikidata has multiple items for infant bed (infant bed, bassinet), the media archive Wikimedia Commons distinguishes between baby beds, bassinets, cradles and cribs among others. ImageNet WordNet has two bassinet synsets, one cradle, one <em>carrycot</em> and one <em>crib</em>, with four of them grouped under <em>baby bed</em>. ImageNet WordNet has two main <em>mask</em> synsets and Wikidata has also two items with the main label &#x201C;mask&#x201D;. They differ slightly in semantics and for the <a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://n03725035">n03725035</a> synset described as &#x201C;A protective covering worn over the face&#x201D;, ImageNet associates images that are not necessarily protective coverings. ImageNet Wordnet has <em>cassette</em> and <em>cassette tape</em> synsets that are difficult to dissociate from their description (&#x201C;a container that holds a magnetic tape used for recording or playing sound or video&#x201D; vs. &#x201C;a cassette that contains magnetic tape&#x201D;). One is grouped under <em>container</em> and the other under <em>memory device</em>. Wikidata&#x0027;s cassette corresponds more to the <em>audiocassette</em> of ImageNet WordNet.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-8">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">4</span> Statistics</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>With a SPARQL query in WDQS, we can count the number of WordNet 3.0 synsets linked from Wikidata:</p>    <p>    <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191645/images/www18companion-384-img1.svg" class="img-responsive" alt=""      longdesc=""/> The response currently yields 324, i.e., approximately a third of the total number of ILSVRC synsets.

The application was implemented in Python using the Keras deep learning framework with a TensorFlow backend. Images were captured real-time from a USB camera with OpenCV. For ImageNet-based image classification, I used the Resnet-50 pre-trained neural network in the form of the <tt>ResNet50</tt> Keras implementation. Before the camera images were feed to the neural model, they were cropped and preprocessed with the <tt>ResNet50</tt> preprocessing method following the example code provided by Fran&#x00E7;ois Chollet at <a class="link-inline force-break"     href="https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models">https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models</a>. The index-based output of the neural network was converted to the associated WordNet synset identifier with the decoder provided by Keras. Only the index associated with the highest probability in prediction was used. This identifier was used for a least-recently-used cached lookup in WDQS to identify the corresponding Wikidata item. The Danish label from Wikidata was overlayed on the camera image and the resulting image displayed on the computer screen via an OpenCV function. The font size was dynamically adjusted to indicate the probability of the classification. Figure&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> shows screenshots of the running application.</p>    <p>Running on a desktop computer with an NVIDIA Quadro K620, the update rate with camera capture, preprocessing, neural computation and display would take around 80 milliseconds for TensorFlow running on the GPU, while around 180 milliseconds if only the CPU was used. If the query returning the label was not cached, then the update would take a few hundred milliseconds extra while querying WDQS.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-10">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">6</span> Discussion</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>I have pointed to several cases of discrepancies between WordNet and associated ImageNet images. This is a problem if the hierarchy of WordNet or Wikidata is used for semantic background knowledge in an image classification setting. Given that ImageNet is used for benchmarking it may be less optimistic to think that the annotation will be changed in ImageNet. How can Wikidata record that certain WordNet synsets are not well represented in ImageNet? One way would be to make a dedicated property for ImageNet synset identifiers in Wikidata, &#x2014; independently of WordNet. These would enable Wikidata to record ImageNet&#x0027;s discrepancies, e.g., with the &#x201C;deprecated&#x201D; feature or by a suitable qualifier attached to the property. A dedicated property may also make certain SPARQL query faster as it would not require the use of the FILTER SPARQL keyword to distinguish between different LOD URI prefixes.</p>    <p>The low number of statements for Wikidata items linked to ILSVRC classes via WordNet synsets poses a problem if we want to utilize these statements to give contexts to the categories identified with ImageNet-trained image classifiers. Even for <em>dog</em>&#x2014;the Wikidata items with the most statements among those items linked to WordNet currently&#x2014;the number of relevant statements to support a semantic characterization is low: Many of the statements are for the property <em>taxon common name</em> (which is just a label) and the number of statements which links to other statements and characterizes the concept of <em>dog</em> well may be argued to be less than 10: It is a subclass of domesticated animal and pet; it can be used as a pet, for hunting and guarding and as a service animal; and it can produce a sound that is a <em>bark</em>. We may contrast that to ConceptNet where there are more statements (assertions), but they are also less formal: According to ConceptNet a dog has a big heart, brains, fleas, four legs, fur, nose, one mouth, paws, penis, teeth, two ears; a dog can be located in the backyard, in bed, on a couch or desk, in a doghouse, etc.; and it is capable of barking, biting and fighting a cat among lots of other activities.<a class="fn" href="#fn9" id="foot-fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> There are opportunities to extend Wikidata with statements that better characterize its items, though it is not readily clear how this can be done. For instance, how should we represent that a dog typically has fur and four legs? Or that in some contexts it forms an antonym with cat? One property that could be used more extensively is <em>has quality</em> (<a class="link-inline force-break" href="http://P1552">P1552</a>) for non-material characteristics. Physical objects may be characterized by, e.g., height and weight, but how should we describe the size of, say, a coffee mug: By an average height and weight over a set of coffee mugs? If yes, then where would we get that data from? Wikidata items may be used to characterize other items, e.g., visual works may be described by what they depict and written works what they are about. For instance, Wikidata can describe that <em>washing machine</em> is the main topic of a set of scientific articles. Yet the examples we have in Wikidata now are mostly medical articles describing accidents with washine machines. It not obvious how such annotations can be used with benefit in ImageNet-based machine learning system.</p>    <p>Regardless of the issues around matching ImageNet synsets with Wikidata items and the questions raised here in the discussion, I see interesting opportunities in the combination of machine learning and a collaborative knowledge base such as Wikidata.</p>   </section>  </section>  <section class="back-matter">   <section id="ref-001">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2 class="page-brake-head">REFERENCES</h2>    </div>    </header>    <ul class="bibUl">    <li id="BibPLXBIB0001" label="[1]"><SmallCap>Bond, F., Vossen, P., McCrae, J.&#x00A0;P., and Fellbaum, C.</SmallCap>CILI: the Collaborative Interlingual Index. <em>Proceedings of the Eighth Global WordNet Conference</em> (January 2016), 50&#x2013;57.</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0002" label="[2]"><SmallCap>Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Li, F.-F.</SmallCap>ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. <em>2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</em> (June 2009).</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0003" label="[3]"><SmallCap>He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., and Sun, J.</SmallCap>Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. <em>2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</em> (December 2015), 770&#x2013;778.</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0004" label="[4]"><SmallCap>Kaffee, L.-A., Piscopo, A., Vougiouklis, P., Simperl, E., Carr, L., and Pintscher, L.</SmallCap>A Glimpse into Babel: An Analysis of Multilinguality in Wikidata. <em>Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Open Collaboration</em> (August 2017).</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0005" label="[5]"><SmallCap>Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., and Hinton, G.</SmallCap>Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. <em>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25</em>(December 2012), 1097&#x2013;1105.</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0006" label="[6]"><SmallCap>Miller, G.&#x00A0;A.</SmallCap>WordNet: a lexical database for English. <em>Communications of the ACM 38</em> (November 1995), 39&#x2013;41.</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0007" label="[7]"><SmallCap>Navigli, R., and Ponzetto, S.&#x00A0;P.</SmallCap>BabelNet: building a very large multilingual semantic network. <em>Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics</em> (July 2010), 216&#x2013;225.</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0008" label="[8]"><SmallCap>Nielsen, F.&#x00A0;&#x00C5;.</SmallCap>Wembedder: Wikidata entity embedding web service.</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0009" label="[9]"><SmallCap>Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A.&#x00A0;C., and Li, F.-F.</SmallCap>ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge.</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0010" label="[10]"><SmallCap>Schmidhuber, J.</SmallCap>Deep learning in neural networks: an overview. <em>Neural Networks 61</em> (October 2014), 85&#x2013;117.</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0011" label="[11]"><SmallCap>Speer, R., Chin, J., and Havasi, C.</SmallCap>ConceptNet 5.5: An Open Multilingual Graph of General Knowledge. <em>Proceedings of the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</em> (December 2016), 4444&#x2013;4451.</li>    <li id="BibPLXBIB0012" label="[12]"><SmallCap>Vrande&#x010D;i&#x0107;, D., and Kr&#x00F6;tzsch, M.</SmallCap>Wikidata: a free collaborative knowledgebase. <em>Communications of the ACM 57</em> (October 2014), 78&#x2013;85.</li>    </ul>   </section>  </section>  <section id="foot-001" class="footnote">   <header>    <div class="title-info">    <h2>FOOTNOTE</h2>    </div>   </header>   <p id="fn1"><a href="#foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>See the discussion on the WN-USER mailing list at <a class="link-inline force-break"    href="https://lists.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1801L=wn-usersF=S=P=1719">https://lists.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1801L=wn-usersF=S=P=1719</a>.
