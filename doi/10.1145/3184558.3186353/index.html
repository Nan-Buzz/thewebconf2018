As satellite imagery promises high-resolution, low-cost, real-time, and ubiquitous data acquisition, this study aims to solve commercial hotness prediction as well as the correlated social contexts mining problem via visual pattern analysis on satellite images. The goal is to reveal the underlying law correlating visual patterns of satellite images with commercial hotness so as to infer the commercial hotness map of a whole city for government regulation and business planning. We propose a novel deep learning-based model, which learns semantic information from raw satellite images to enable predicting regional commercial hotness. First, we collect satellite images from Google Map and label such images with POI categories according to the annotations from OpenStreetMap. Then, we train a model of deep convolutional networks that leverage raw images to infer the social attributes of the region of interest. Finally, we use three classical regression methods to predict regional commercial hotness from the corresponding social contexts reflected in satellite images in Shanghai, where the applied deep features are learned from the examples of Beijing to guarantee the generality. The result shows that the proposed model is robust enough to reach 82% precision at average. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work focused on discovering relations between commercial hotness and satellite images.

New commercial centers are arising quickly, while old centers might be decaying [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]. In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>], some laws regarding the developing and decaying of regions are summarized from computer vision analysis over streetscapes. Except for such insight into the varying appearances of cities in a qualitative sense, we understand neither how city infrastructures affect economy nor we know the quantitative correlation between city infrastructures and economic indices. As some cities are developing vary fast, a critical issue is to learn lessons from the past to enable better city planning in the future. Due to the lack of knowledge regarding the impact of city infrastructures on commercial activeness, so far, city planning from the economic point of view remains a missing topic. Moreover, it is crucial for business owners to get recommendations on choosing suitable locations for their business so as to maximize the profits, for which an operational way is to establish a predictor based on revealing the relation between city infrastructures and commercial activeness. <figure id="fig1">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186353/images/www18companion-115-fig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 1"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span>      <span class="figure-title">The main framework: First, train a deep learning-based model using satellite images and OpenStreetMap labels.

The predicted value of the commercial hotness of this region will be calculated along with the statistical distribution of the ground objects corresponding with the 6 classes of POIs of interest.</span>     </div>     </figure>    </p>    <p>So far, how commercial hotness is shaped by city infrastructures has never been fully understood. Luckily, the abundant resources of big data at this age provide new means to percept city infrastructures as well as the underlying laws governing the formation of commercial hotness. As city infrastructures change with regions, intuitively, the social functions underlying the infrastructures of a region should have impact on the formation of commercial hotness, for example, transportation networks, the number of houses and offices, and the scale of shopping centers if any. In general, different configuration of such resources for a region should lead to different commercial hotness. Since all city infrastructures are visible in satellite images, in this study, we propose to make use of satellite images to investigate the correlation between city infrastructures and commercial hotness. Satellite imagery has the following natures: (1) Ubiquitous: Images of almost all cities on earth are available; (2) Low-cost: We can download free satellite images from websites such as Google Map while there are also paid services to obtain satellite images, which are not very expensive; (3) Nearly real-time: It is possible to obtain high-resolution satellite images per hour, and as a result, tracing the development of regions in a city becomes easy.</p>    <p>In fact, satellite imagery has become a major means for urban perception. The previous studies are mainly focused on recognizing ground objects such as roads, buildings, and natural plants, or detecting changes of ground objects through image registration. Recently, the trend of the state-of-the-art researches has been shifted to knowledge discovery on association between visual patterns of satellite image and socioeconomic indices so as to establish a predictive model to percept location-aware social contexts or economic issues over satellite images. In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>], Jean etc. propose to use convolutional neural networks along with transferring learning to learn features for predicting the poverty across a country from nighttime light intensities over satellite images. In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>], road safety is predicted from satellite images by learning the correlation between the historical data of accidents and the satellite images in the framework of deep learning. In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>], convolutional neural networks are applied to tackle the problem of land use classification. Nevertheless, learning the mapping from satellite images to broad-spectrum social-economic issues is an open problem yet, and commercial hotness prediction from satellite images is so far a missing topic in terms of urban perception.</p>    <p>The goal of this study is to discover the relation between the visual patterns of satellite images and commercial activeness. Once a predictor from satellite images to commercial hotness can be established by mining the correlation between them, city planning as well as business planning can be conducted in a rational way on the basis of referring to the map of commercial hotness over satellite images, which is a byproduct turned out from the predictor by applying the image of the region of interest as input. By producing the map of commercial hotness region by region, it leads to an integral profile in terms of commercial activeness over city infrastructures throughout the city, which visualizes the city from the economic perspective for city planners. Moreover, for newly developed regions with short history and few data, the predicted commercial hotness over satellite images becomes an important clue to foresee the future in terms of business planning. To approach high prediction precision, the key is to reveal the correlation between satellite images and commercial hotness from historical data, and develop an inference mechanism to approximate such correlation as close as possible. However, it is not an easy task due to the heterogeneous data. Although deep learning has been successfully applied to urban perception from satellite imagery [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>], directly predicting commercial hotness from satellite images is not practical. The main reason lies in that the satellite images are in a highly unstructured form with seemingly irregular visual patterns and deep learning models can hardly find explicit clues of commercial activities on raw satellite images. To overcome this problem, we propose to establish a semantic layer between satellite image and commercial activeness. The semantic layer captures social functions and city infrastructures from raw image data. Then, prediction of commercial activeness is performed based on identification of city infrastructures at the semantic layer. The motivation is as follows: On one hand, it has been revealed that the commercial hotness of a given region is subject to the social contexts in and around the region of interest [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>] and Point of Interest (POI) plays an important role, namely, the class label of the city function for a given location such as shopping mall or transportation facility. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that coarse-gained POI can be recognized from satellite images [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. This gives rise to an interesting problem: Is it possible to predict commercial hotness from satellite images through POI? Therefore, we make use of the annotations from <em>OpenStreetMap</em>, which is a crowdsourcing project to create a free editable map of the world, to label each image with a class label of POI. Then, a deep convolutional model can be trained to classify these labeled images so as to identify the city infrastructures indicated by the corresponding POI categories. We divide the city of interest into a grid of multiple regions. In each region, we use the deep learning model to produce a mean feature vector representing the statistical distribution of POIs. Then, some regression methods, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), are used to predict commercial hotness given the regional features of POIs. To evaluate the generality of the proposed method, we apply the model trained from one city to predict the commercial hotness in another city. The highest prediction accuracy is 82%, which indicates that there is a close relation between satellite images and commercial activities. The main framework of the proposed method is shown in Fig. <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>. Additionally, to demonstrate our idea of commercial hotness prediction from satellite imagery, we develop a web service portal, which is shown in Fig. <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>.</p>    <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize satellite imagery to predict commercial hotness. Contributions made in this paper are summarized as follows:</p>    <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list1" label="&#x2022;">A framework is proposed for commercial hotness prediction on the basis of leveraging a deep neural network to percept the social functions reflected in satellite images, followed by a decision tree-based inference mechanism to mine the association between social functions and commercial hotness. This can help city planners to learn lessons for further city planning. From the technical point of view, the system works due to the implementation as follows: Raw satellite images make no sense in terms of semantics and it is hard to correlate directly the raw data of satellite images to commercial activeness. Thus, we propose to add a semantic middle layer between the visual patterns and commercial activeness. That is, we make use of OpenStreetMap to produce additional annotations so as to learn and infer the statistics of social functions, say, POIs, from satellite images.<br/></li>     <li id="list2" label="&#x2022;">We predict the city-scale commercial hotness for Shanghai with an accuracy of 82% using the deep features learned from Beijing, which proves the generality of the method.<br/></li>     <li id="list3" label="&#x2022;">We develop a web service portal to demonstrate predicting commercial hotness in an interactive manner for any region in Shanghai, which provides easy-to-use decision support for business location planning.<br/></li>    </ul>   </section>   <section id="sec-6">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> Related Works</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>To the best of our knowledge, so far, there is no open report on commercial hotness prediction with satellite imagery. Yet, some studies have been conducted aiming to predict social contexts from raw satellite images. In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>], deep learning and transfer learning are used to predict poverty using satellite images. Due to the lack of poverty data, it is almost impossible to train a network to predict poverty directly and night lights are used as a proxy to solve this problem. Satellite images are also used to predict urban land use [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>], road safety [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>], and urban air quality [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>].</p>    <p>There are also many other works leveraging computer vision methods to achieve urban perception. Urban perception refers to using modern sensors (for example, satellite sensors) to collect urban big data for analyzing, planning, and predicting urban social attributes. In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>], traditional computer vision methods are used to predict safety scores from streetscapes. Deep learning is utilized to advance technically this task in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>]. Except for safety scores, more social attributes can be predicted such as violent crimes [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] and the distance to the closest commercial center [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. Some other studies are focused on city identity recognition, such as [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] and [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>].</p>    <p>This study is the first work devoted to discovering the correlation between visual features of satellite images and commercial hotness. The most related work is [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>], where they predict the closet distance to a commercial center, which is implicitly correlated to commercial hotness. However, [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>] uses streetscapes rather than satellite imagery, which should provide a more direct lens to measure the distance between ground objects. Although streetscapes and satellite images are both free data with easy accessbility, we prefer satellite imagery due to the following reasons: In view of the rapidly changing nature of city infrastructures, satellite imagery promises ubiquitous and real-time data acquisition against city development.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-7">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">3</span> Data</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>The data collection steps are as follows:</p>    <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list4" label="&#x2022;">Both satellite images and labels are needed to train the deep learning-based model. Using Google Map API, we download satellite images of Beijing<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>1</sup></a>. All the images are at zoom level 18. Then, we download the OpenStreetMap data of Beijing to produce the corresponding image labels. We randomly sample 48,000 images for training, and 12,000 images for evaluation. The details will be described in the following section.<br/></li>     <li id="list5" label="&#x2022;">We use the trained deep models to generate attributes for regions, which can be regarded as the features applied to predicting commercial hotness.

We use the data from Dianping.com, the biggest website in China to share comments on commercial entities, the function of which is similar to that of Yelp in US. The data include geographical locations, user comments and user&#x0027;s rating.

So, POI identification is essential in terms of predicting commercial hotness. As far as we know, annotation of POI labels over geographical data highly relies on labor-intensive manual works. As satellite images can provide coarse profiles of region functions and have been used to classify land uses in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>], this study aims to automate POI classification and commercial hotness prediction from raw satellite image data as a whole, where deep learning is applied to achieve optimization for POI classification, which acts as the basis for commercial activeness prediction.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-8">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">4</span> Methodology</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>Our goal is to predict commercial hotness from raw satellite images. However, commercial activities are subject to many factors, such as the total number of residents, the real purchasing power of the residents, and the density of shops. Directly mapping raw satellite images to commercial hotness is not practical, even with a deep learning predictor. The reason lies in that satellite imagery leads to a highly unstructured form of data such that it is hard to obtain explicit clues indicating reliably social attributes.</p>    <p>We use OpenStreetMap as a supplementary data source for data labeling with POI categories. OpenStreetMap is a project aiming to build map data over the world. All data on OpenStreetMap are free to download. Given this map data, we can assign a class label for each image. Thus, we can successfully train a deep learning classifier for raw satellite images. The trained model should be robust enough to be applicable to another city, where the model is used to generate a regional feature vector by classifying all the image blocks inside the region of interest. We view this feature vector as a <em>social context representation</em> since it is obtained under the supervision of POI from OpenStreetMap, based on which we can proceed to predicting commercial hotness. The main framework of the proposed method is shown in Fig. <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>.</p>    <p>In the following, we describe the proposed method in detail. First, we explain how we assign the image labels using OpenStreetMap data.

Finally, we describe how we use the feature vector to predict commercial hotness.</p>    <section id="sec-9">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">4.1</span> Label Images Using OpenStreetMap Data</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>OpenStreetMap offers detailed map information for almost all areas of the world. The basic data structure of OpenStreetMap is node, way, and relation. Node is the most basic concept. It stands for a single point on the map, which consists of a latitude, a longitude, and a node id. A way is an ordered list of nodes. It can be open or closed. In a closed way, the last node and the first node are identical but they are not the same for an open way. Roads, railways, and streams are represented with open ways, while closed ways are used to define meaningful areas like residential spots, business districts, industrial areas, and schools. Relation is a concept to describe relationship between nodes and ways.</p>     <p>In this paper, we use <em>closed way</em> to label raw satellite images. According to its definition, we can view a closed way as a polygonal area with tag information. Overall, there are over 2,000 tags on OpenStreetMap<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id="foot-fn4"><sup>3</sup></a>. In practice, most tags are rarely used. We only use the tags that are widely used and related to commercial activities. One tag corresponds with one class. <figure id="fig3">      <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186353/images/www18companion-115-fig3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 3"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 3:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Use OpenStreetMap data to generate labels for satellite tiles.

If it exceeds a predefined threshold (In all experiments, it is 70%), we will assign the class label to the image tile according to the tag of the way, which is illustrated in Fig. <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-10">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">4.2</span> Train a Deep Learning-based Classifier</h3>     </div>     </header>     <figure id="fig4">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186353/images/www18companion-115-fig4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 4"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 4:</span>      <span class="figure-title">The CNN model to classify labeled satellite images: The model takes a single image <em>S<sub>i</sub>       </em> as an input; The output is a probability that the input belongs to each class (denoted as <em>C<sub>i</sub>       </em>).</span>     </div>     </figure>     <p>Once labeled satellite images are available, we can train a deep learning-based classifier. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify raw satellite images. A CNN is a class of deep feed-forwarded networks. It has been proven successful when applied to computer vision tasks. Traditional machine learning methods for image data usually start with handcrafting features. This kind of work needs much domain knowledge and labor. A CNN model can learn to extract features automatically from raw images. Thus, using a CNN model can not only save time, but also improve the final performance dramatically.</p>     <p>The CNN model takes a raw satellite image (denoted as <em>S<sub>i</sub>     </em>) as an input and produces class-dependent probabilities as an output, where <em>S<sub>i</sub>     </em> is an RGB image with fixed width and height. Although raw satellite images are unstructured and only contain low-level features, the CNN model can learn to approach the semantically meaningful targets under the supervision of POI labels. This process is accomplished by stacked convolutional layers. One convolutional layer usually consists of 3 parts: The first part is a convolutional kernel, which is responsible to perform convolutional transformation upon the inputed 3-D tensor. The 3 dimensions of the tensor are width, height, and channel. This tensor is also known as the feature map. Then, the result is fed to an activation function to perform nonlinear transform, where Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is often used. The third part is a pooling layer, which makes the output to be more robust against minor disturbances. The stacked structure of convolutional layers makes it easier to capture the visual patterns of an RGB image hierarchically. The lower convolutional layers can learn to extract low-level features such as colors and edges, while the deeper layers function to extract semantic features like shapes and objects. Those deep features are followed by some fully-connected layers with a softmax function to produce the probability belonging to each class.</p>     <p>The CNN model is usually trained in a supervised manner using stochastic gradient descent methods.</p>     <p>We denote the output of the CNN model as <em>C<sub>i</sub>     </em>, which is a class-dependent probability with k possible classes in total.

For example, one satellite image could only contain a part of a house at a high zoom level. This kind of information is too minor to make sense. However, if we switch to a lower zoom level, some details will be missing due to the limited resolution. Thus, we predict commercial hotness over regions instead. We divide the whole city into a grid of <em>n</em> &#x00D7; <em>m</em> regions (Denoted as <em>Region<sub>j</sub>     </em>, <em>j</em> = 1..<em>n</em> &#x00D7; <em>m</em>). Each region contains a couple of image blocks. As shown in Fig. <a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a>, we can obtain class-dependent probability values for each image block using the trained deep model.

All images are at zoom level 18 and have a resolution of 256 &#x00D7; 256. Then, we use OpenStreetMap data to produce labeled images. The method to label every single image has been described previously. We use 6 tags, in other words, 6 classes, to train the CNN classifier: Water, wood, residential area, industrial area, commercial area, and farmland. 10,000 images are sampled for each class randomly. Then, we divide the images into training and validation set. For each class, there are 8,000 images used for training and 2,000 images for validation.</p>     <p>Our model does not limit the total number of classes.

We propose a approach that takes advantage of the state-of-the-art CNN models and leverages open data to obtain a robust model for prediction.</p>    <p>To validate the proposed method, we first train a CNN model based on a large satellite image dataset, which contains 60,000 images of Beijing collected from Google Map API. The satellite images are labeled by using the OpenStreetMap data as a supplementary data source. Our best model achieves 74.3% classification accuracy on 6 classes in terms of identifying POI labels. Then, we apply the deep features resulting from the model to predict commercial hotness in Shanghai. It is done by predicting the number of comments on commercial entities region by region. We use the deep learning model to yield a social context feature vector for each region. On the other hand, the region is labeled using the log-form of online comments collected from Dianping.com. We employ three classical regression methods, Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), to predict the commercial hotness value. The best result is achieved by the GBDT model with a <em>R</em>     <sup>2</sup> value of 0.822, which proves that our model can promise commercial hotness prediction from satellite imagery with reasonable precision. Finally, we use the best model to build an online web service, which enables commercial hotness prediction of any region in Shanghai.</p>    <p>The experimental results confirm: (1) It is feasible to predict commercial hotness from satellite imagery. The visual features contained in satellite images can be a good indicator of commercial activities. (2) The state-of-the-art CNN model does help us to achieve high prediction accuracy with good generality across cities. (3) We can use satellite imagery to predict commercial activities at city scale with relatively lower cost.</p>    <p>Although our method is practical on account of the high accuracy, it suffers from some limitations: First, our model is not an end-to-end system, which directly maps commercial hotness from satellite imagery using deep learning method. The reason is that predicting commercial hotness from a single image is almost impossible. So, we do prediction region by region. Second, we treat the number of web comment as a proxy of commercial hotness. This is easy-to-obtain but might not be exactly precise. Third, we train our model in Beijing and validate it in Shanghai. It has been proved that the model has good generalization power within a country due to the similar visual appearance in satellite images. More experiments can be carried out to see if the model can be generalized over countries (e.g., training in China and then predicting in America). These limitations are to be solved in future works.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-17">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">7</span> Acknowledgements</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>This work is supported by NSFC (grant NO. 61472087) and Shanghai Science and Technology Commission (grant No. 1751110420).</p>   </section>  </section>  <section class="back-matter">   <section id="ref-001">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2 class="page-brake-head">REFERENCES</h2>     </div>    </header>    <ul class="bibUl">     <li id="BibPLXBIB0001" label="[1]">Mart&#x00ED;n Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg&#x00A0;S Corrado, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, <em>et al.</em> 2016.
