        <p><small>We set out to understand the effects of differing
        language on the ability of cybercriminals to navigate
        webmail accounts and locate sensitive information in them.
        To this end, we configured thirty Gmail honeypot accounts
        with English, Romanian, and Greek language settings. We
        populated the accounts with email messages in those
        languages by subscribing them to selected online
        newsletters. We also hid email messages about fake bank
        accounts in fifteen of the accounts to mimic real-world
        webmail users that sometimes store sensitive information in
        their accounts. We then leaked credentials to the honey
        accounts via paste sites on the Surface Web and the Dark
        Web, and collected data for fifteen days. Our statistical
        analyses on the data show that cybercriminals are more
        likely to discover sensitive information (bank account
        information) in the Greek accounts than the remaining
        accounts, contrary to the expectation that Greek ought to
        constitute a barrier to the understanding of non-Greek
        visitors to the Greek accounts. We also extracted the
        important words among the emails that cybercriminals
        accessed (as an approximation of the keywords that they
        possibly searched for within the honey accounts), and found
        that financial terms featured among the top words. In
        summary, we show that language plays a significant role in
        the ability of cybercriminals to access sensitive
        information hidden in compromised webmail
        accounts.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Online accounts provide many useful functionalities but
      also expose users to certain risks. For instance, we send
      emails, edit documents, and interact with colleagues via
      online accounts. Consequently, these accounts not only
      provide these capabilities, but also often become
      repositories of sensitive information such as passwords and
      financial information. Webmail accounts are particularly
      “susceptible” to this, since they mostly store private
      information by design. This makes them attractive to
      miscreants that seek to make a fortune from the content of
      such accounts.</p>
      <p>Data breaches and unauthorized account accesses are
      commonplace nowadays, usually at high financial and
      reputation costs to victims and online service providers
      alike&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>].
      Cybercriminals often compromise online accounts by performing
      social engineering or phishing attacks on
      victims&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. Other ways by which cybercriminals
      obtain credentials and compromise online accounts include
      database breaches,<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> information-stealing
      malware&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>], and network attacks.<a class="fn"
      href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
      <p>After obtaining the credentials of online accounts,
      cybercriminals usually assess the value of such accounts by
      evaluating the content of the compromised accounts and
      searching for sensitive information&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. Depending on the
      perceived value of the accounts, the miscreants then sell the
      account credentials on the underground black
      market&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]
      or use them privately. In some cases, cybercriminals carry
      out further attacks against the owners of such accounts, for
      instance by mounting blackmail attacks against them as seen
      in the Ashley Madison online dating website scandal.<a class=
      "fn" href="#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> In other
      cases, the compromised accounts are used to attack other
      online users, for instance by sending spam messages to the
      contacts of the account owner&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>].</p>
      <p>Existing literature on the use of compromised online
      accounts by cybercriminals is sparse. This is primarily
      because it is difficult to collect data on compromised
      accounts without being in control of a large online service.
      Bursztein et al. studied Gmail accounts that were compromised
      via phishing attacks, to understand the modes of operation of
      cybercriminals that gained illegitimate access to the
      accounts&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. Similarly, [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>] studied the modus
      operandi of miscreants accessing Gmail accounts leaked
      through multiple outlets. Lazarov et al. investigated the
      activity of miscreants on leaked online
      spreadsheets&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>].</p>
      <p>Online accounts often allow users to customize their
      accounts in various ways, for instance through language
      localization. A question then comes to mind – how do
      cybercriminals behave when they encounter accounts in an
      unfamiliar locale or language? How will this affect their
      activity? To the best of our knowledge, there is limited
      existing research on this theme. To close this research gap,
      we studied the impact of differences in account language on
      the activity of miscreants that connect to compromised Gmail
      accounts.</p>
      <p>Thus, we employed the publicly-available
      infrastructure<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id=
      "foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> and methodology proposed
      in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>].
      We created and instrumented thirty Gmail accounts, and
      populated them with email messages in three languages, namely
      English, Greek, and Romanian. We seeded fifteen of the
      accounts with fake bank details containing keywords that are
      known to be appealing to cybercriminals. We then leaked
      credentials to the accounts through paste sites on the
      Surface and Dark Webs, following the approach
      in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>],
      and recorded activity in the accounts.</p>
      <p>We found that cybercriminals are more likely to discover
      fake bank account details hidden in the Greek accounts than
      the remaining accounts. This is contrary to our expectation
      that Greek ought to constitute a barrier to the understanding
      of non-Greek visitors to the Greek accounts. Previous work
      shows that cybercriminals usually assess the value of stolen
      accounts by searching for valuable information in
      them&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. Thus, we
      postulate that the cybercriminals possibly used online
      language translation tools to translate financial terms to
      Greek prior to searching the Greek accounts for such
      keywords. This would also explain the amount of time that
      they spent accessing the accounts: Greek accounts recorded
      longer access times than the rest, while English accounts
      recorded the lowest access times.</p>
      <p>Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we
      extracted important words from the emails that cybercriminals
      accessed (as an approximation of the keywords that they
      searched for within the honey accounts), and found that
      financial terms featured among the top words. This is
      interesting because some of the sensitive words with which we
      seeded the honey accounts also showed up among those
      important words. This indicates that the cybercriminals paid
      particular attention to those sensitive emails.</p>
      <p>In summary, we found that language indeed affects the
      ability of cybercriminals to locate sensitive information in
      webmail accounts. Our statistical tests show that there is a
      significant relationship between language and criminal
      activity in webmail accounts. We also corroborate previous
      findings that cybercriminals search for financial and other
      sensitive information in compromised webmail
      accounts&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>].</p>
      <p><strong>Contributions.&nbsp;</strong>We provide detailed
      statistical analyses showing that language differentiation
      affects the ability of cybercriminals to locate sensitive
      information in a compromised webmail account. To the best of
      our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the
      relationship between language and criminal ability.</p>

            of cybercrime</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Broadly speaking, cybercrime is a term used to describe
        a wide variety of instances within which technology is used
        or involved in the execution of a criminal
        act&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. It embodies a variety of criminal
        activities (for instance, identity theft and fraud), many
        of which are among the most rapidly advancing crime types
        in developed countries&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. We discuss the three distinct
        categories of cybercrime, namely cyber-assisted crimes,
        cyber-dependent crimes, and cyber-enabled
        crimes&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>].</p>
        <p><strong>Cyber-assisted crimes.&nbsp;</strong>These are
        terrestrial crimes, such as burglary or theft, which
        incorporate the use of digital technologies into the
        execution of a criminal act&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>]. An example of this is
        when a bicycle thief uses a mapping application to plan a
        route through the area they already intended to steal from.
        In cyber-assisted crime, the “cyber” element plays a
        tertiary role in the execution of the crime itself, that
        is, the crime would likely continue unaffected if the cyber
        element was removed. This type of cybercrime is not in the
        scope of this paper.</p>
        <p><strong>Cyber-dependent crimes.&nbsp;</strong>These are
        crimes that can be executed without the use of an Internet
        connection, but use technology as a force multiplier to
        commit terrestrial crimes within a
        “cyber-sphere”&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. These crimes often take advantage
        of the global reach of the Internet but do not necessarily
        represent entirely new crime types. An example is bank
        fraud which existed before the Internet but has been
        greatly facilitated by the growth of the Internet.</p>
        <p><strong>Cyber-enabled crimes.&nbsp;</strong>These
        represent the “cybercrime archetype.” These crimes cannot
        be committed without the use of an Internet connection or a
        computer network, for instance, a Distributed Denial of
        Service (DDoS) attack&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>].</p>
        <p>Although debate exists regarding small differences and
        measurement of these crime types&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>], our intent in this
        paper is not to provide detailed insight into crime types
        or classifications. Instead, we focus on cyber-dependent
        and cyber-enabled crimes since we study the actions of
        criminals connect to webmail accounts.</p>

        <p>Gmail accounts, like many other webmail accounts, allow
        users to send and receive text/multimedia messages to one
        another. However, beyond sending and receiving email
        messages, Gmail users can embed scripts in their accounts
        to automatically carry out other activities, for instance,
        to remind them about important emails that require
        attention. We leveraged this functionality to instrument
        the Gmail accounts that we used in our experiments, by
        configuring the scripts to send us notifications about
        changes in the accounts.</p>
        <p>After authenticating to their accounts, Gmail users can
        access the email messages that other webmail users sent to
        them in the <em>Inbox</em> folder. While composing email
        messages in preparation for sending to other webmail users,
        those email drafts appear in the <em>Drafts</em> folder.
        Similarly, users can access the email messages that they
        previously sent to others in the <em>Sent</em> folder. They
        can mark emails for later reference by <em>starring</em>
        them. Gmail also provides a text search tool. Finally,
        users can change the display language of their Gmail
        interface so that menu items and options on Gmail pages
        will be displayed in the selected language.</p>

        <p>Research suggests that criminal activities are carried
        out along familiar patterns of behavior, spatially, by
        crime type, or by the network of the actors&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. This
        suggests that successful criminals rely heavily on a
        detailed understanding of the processes surrounding the
        crimes they commit and the areas within which they are
        committed&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>]. Thus, we can safely assume that
        the ability to understand and interpret social cues, their
        environment, and the behavior of their victims has a
        knock-on effect on their ability to commit
        crime&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>].</p>
        <p>When attempting to study the behavioral patterns of
        criminals online, connecting to a webmail account and
        navigating through it can be considered “routine activity”
        since these are frequent actions by legitimate users.
        Changes in the composition, interface, layout, or language
        of the webmail account can therefore be considered a
        barrier to the execution of crime in the account – much
        like a physical barrier (for instance, a fence) may deter
        terrestrial crime. This forms the thematic basis for our
        work.</p>
        <p>Certain other aspects of criminal theory developed for
        terrestrial crime types have shown promise in their ability
        to be adapted to fit cybercrime types&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

        locality or geographical nodes from crime pattern theories
        may need to be replaced with cyber equivalents, certain
        trends and routine online activities have been successfully
        attributed to specific online criminals&nbsp;[<a class=

        <p>There is a commonplace “truism” when discussing
        cybercrime: that cybercrime is somehow unrestricted by the
        same boundaries of time, space, and culture that may hinder
        traditional crime types&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. However, the majority of
        contentions in previous work were made through logical
        inferences and assertions. In particular, after exploring
        previous work in the domains of crime sciences and
        language, we found very little research exploring the
        relationship between language and crime. This paper seeks
        to close that research gap and provide insights into
        whether the execution of a criminal act is indeed affected
        by language differences and comprehension, or not. To this
        end, we define our research question and hypotheses as
        follows.</p>
        <p><strong>Research question.&nbsp;</strong>Does language
        differentiation affect cybercriminal activity?</p>
        <p><strong>Hypothesis 0 (<em>H</em>
        <sub>0</sub>).&nbsp;</strong>Language differentiation will
        not have a significant impact on the ability of
        cybercriminals to locate a sensitive item in a compromised
        webmail account.</p>
        <p><strong>Hypothesis 1 (<em>H</em>
        <sub>1</sub>).&nbsp;</strong>Language differentiation will
        have a significant impact on the ability of cybercriminals
        to locate a sensitive item in a compromised webmail

            honey accounts</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>We created thirty honey accounts on Gmail across three
        languages, namely English (ten accounts), Romanian (ten
        accounts), and Greek (ten accounts). We chose those
        languages for linguistic reasons; English because it is an
        “international” language, Romanian because it is the only
        Latin-based Eastern European language, and Greek because it
        features a unique alphabet. In order to minimize potential
        biases in our dataset, we configured the fake personas of
        the honey accounts such that each linguistic group
        comprised five men and five women with birth dates ranging
        from 1960 to 2000.</p>
        <p>To populate the accounts, we subscribed them to over
        fifty language-specific newsletters and mailing lists
        following certain themes. Those themes include fashion,
        law, and gardening, and were picked according to the
        genders and dates of birth of fake personas we chose for
        the accounts. We also changed the display language of each
        account to match the language of its content. Figure
        <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> shows the Gmail language
        configuration option that allows this.</p>
        <p><strong>Sensitive emails.&nbsp;</strong> In fifteen out
        of thirty honey accounts, we hid fake online banking
        information. The idea was to mimic the behavior of webmail
        users that store sensitive information in their accounts.
        To achieve this, we created screenshots of fake bank
        account details and online banking pages (see Figures
        <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> and <a class="fig" href=
        "#fig3">3</a>), and sent emails containing those
        screenshots to the honey accounts themselves. For each
        honey account <em>h<sub>G</sub></em> designated to contain
        sensitive information, we sent the screenshots described
        earlier from <em>h<sub>G</sub></em> to itself. We used
        region-specific bank information while seeding the
        accounts, for instance, fake Natwest and Santander
        information for English accounts, fake ING information for
        Romanian accounts, and fake Alpha Bank profiles for Greek
        accounts. We did this to ensure that the banks would be
        instantly recognizable in the designated countries of the
        honey accounts. We also included keywords such as
        <em>national insurance number</em>, <em>sort code</em>, and
        <em>account number</em> in the sensitive emails. Such
        keywords have been shown to be attractive to
        cybercriminals&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. Finally, we left the remaining
        fifteen accounts unseeded to enable comparisons between
        accounts containing sensitive information and those without
        sensitive information.</p>

        <p>To monitor illegitimate activity in the honey accounts,

        "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>]. It comprises scripts embedded in
        the honey accounts, a sinkhole mail server, a notification
        store to receive activity notifications from honey
        accounts, a mail client to retrieve email messages from the
        notification store, and other monitor scripts (see Figure

        </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>This infrastructure provides us with information about
        activity in honey accounts, specifically when emails are
        opened, sent, or starred. It also provides us with
        information about draft emails created by visitors to the
        honey accounts. In addition, we receive “heartbeat”
        messages daily from each honey account to notify us about
        accounts that are active. We cease to receive “heartbeat”
        messages from an account if it has been suspended by
        Google, or if it was hijacked completely by cybercriminals,
        that is, if they changed the account's password. Finally,
        the system provides us with information on accesses to the
        honey accounts; we receive IP addresses, location
        information, access times, and other details about visitors
        interacting with the honey accounts.</p>
        <p>To minimize the risk of abuse, we configured the honey
        accounts’ default send-from addresses to point to a mail
        server which is part of the monitor infrastructure
        described earlier. Hence, all emails sent from the honey
        accounts would be delivered to our mail server and not to
        the outside world, since our mail server is a sinkhole
        server (it does not forward emails to the intended
        destination).</p>

        accessible only through special software, such as TOR
        browser. <tt>Pastebin</tt> is accessible via any common web
        browser, for instance Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. In each
        leak, we included sets of honey account credentials and
        captions indicating that the credentials were obtained from
        hacked accounts. Each set contained between 10 to 15
        credentials. We then recorded accesses made to the honey
        accounts by miscreants.</p>

            validity</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>It is important to mention that the monitoring
        infrastructure we used in this study can only detect if an
        email was opened; not necessarily if it was read. For the
        purpose of this study, we assume that opened emails were
        also read by the person that opened them. In addition, we
        currently lack a way to determine the exact words that were
        searched for in the honey accounts by cybercriminals.
        Instead, we approximate those search terms by evaluating
        important words in the emails that were opened by
        cybercriminals. We consider this the main threat to
        internal validity of this study. To minimize the impact of
        this threat, we seeded the accounts with email messages
        containing sensitive content (fake financial information)
        and hid the emails, such that finding them would require
        some effort by the cybercriminals. We then focused our
        analysis on those sensitive emails. In future work, we hope
        to find a more accurate way to determine search terms in
        honey accounts. Another threat to internal validity is that
        many of the honey accounts were hijacked at least once by
        cybercriminals, that is, the passwords of such accounts
        were changed. Recall that we are unable to collect access
        and activity information from a honey account when that
        happens. However, we were able to recover some of the
        accounts and continue the experiments. Finally, we leaked
        account credentials through paste sites only, therefore our
        results may not necessarily reflect what happens when
        accounts are compromised via other outlets.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Due to the sensitive nature of our study, we ensured
        that experiments were carried out in an ethical manner.
        Since the experiments require releasing account credentials
        to cybercriminals, there is the risk of abuse. We minimized
        this risk by configuring the honey accounts to send all
        outgoing emails to a mail server under our control which
        does not deliver emails to their intended destinations.
        Thus, we were able to prevent the accounts from being used
        for spamming. Also, we seeded the honey accounts with
        financial information such as bank accounts and online
        banking information. To avoid harming anyone, we ensured
        that all financial details loaded in the accounts were fake
        (we generated them randomly). Finally, since our
        experiments involve deceiving cybercriminals to engage with
        fake accounts, we obtained ethics approval from our
        institution.</p>

      <p>A Gmail account keeps records of each unique access and
      labels the access with a unique identifier also known as a
      <em>cookie</em>, along with other information such as access
      time, IP address, and location. We extracted this information
      from the honey accounts via the honeypot infrastructure
      described earlier. We also evaluated the actions
      corresponding to those accesses (for instance, email opening,
      sending, starring, or draft creation). In other words, each
      data unit encapsulates an <em>access–action</em> (for
      instance, <em>COOKIE–OPEN</em>).</p>
      <p>During a period of , we recorded data units across 29
      honey accounts, from countries. 210 of those data units
      originated from miscreants that carried out a lot of unusual
      actions in the accounts, for instance, reading all emails in
      the accounts that they connected to — in other words, those
      data units are outliers. Also note that some aspects of our
      analysis require comparing accessed emails to emails that
      were not accessed. Hence, we excluded those 210 outliers
      since they were not useful for our analysis.</p>
      <p>In this section, we present the results of statistical
      tests and textual analysis on the data. We establish the
      relationship between language and cybercriminal ability, and
      also show some keywords that cybercriminals were interested
      in.</p>

        <p>Recall that we set out to understand the relationship
        between the language of an account and activity/ability of
        criminals on that account. Hence, to determine whether such
        a relationship exists or not, we conducted a chi-squared
        (<em>χ</em> <sup>2</sup>) test&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>] to assess any possible
        associations between discrete languages variables (Greek,
        Romanian, and English), and the ability of the
        cybercriminal to access sensitive items in the
        accounts.</p>
        <p>The Pearson <em>χ</em> <sup>2</sup> test (see Table
        <a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a>) shows that there is
        indeed a significant association between language and the
        ability of a cybercriminal to locate sensitive items within
        an email account (<em>χ</em> <sup>2</sup>(2) = 15.3097,
        <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Due to the risk of inflation, we
        also generated a Cramer's <em>V</em>
        statistic&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] to reveal further information about
        the strength of the association. This confirmed that there
        was a weak, yet significant association between language
        and cybercriminal ability (<em>V</em> = 0.1865). However,
        it must be noted that <em>χ</em> <sup>2</sup> tables are
        relatively unable to provide more substantive information
        regarding the interactions between the variables or the fit
        of the implemented model. Thus, we carried out logistic
        regression to further explore if a substantive relationship
        exists among the three language variables and criminal
        activity (see Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a>). We
        found that the language variables, in combination,
        significantly affected the ability of a cybercriminal to
        find a sensitive item (<em>χ</em> <sup>2</sup>(3) = 19.77,
        <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), with the model accurately
        predicting 81.59% of criminal action. Note that we dropped
        the Romanian data points from the analysis in name due to
        collinearity, and henceforth refer to them as <em>Cons</em>
        in subsequent analyses (see Tables <a class="tbl" href=
        "#tab2">2</a>, <a class="tbl" href="#tab3">3</a>, and
        <a class="tbl" href="#tab4">4</a>).</p>
        <p>Further analysis revealed a significant positive
        relationship between the ability to locate a sensitive item
        and Greek language sets (<em>z</em> = 2.52, <em>p</em> &lt;
        0.01) with an odds ratio of 2.316176, meaning that accounts
        established in Greek are more than twice as likely to have
        a sensitive item accessed than either of the other language
        sets. English language as a variable was not significant
        (<em>z</em> = −0.63, <em>p</em> = 0.530) with an odds ratio
        of 0.8123249. This means that an account being constructed
        in English actually lessens the chance of a miscreant
        accessing a sensitive item in it. We obtained similar
        results for the Romanian account set which was significant
        (<em>z</em> = −6.30, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01) with an odds
        ratio of 0.1888889. This indicates that there is a
        significant negative relationship between emails written in
        Romanian and the ability of a criminal to locate sensitive
        items in them.</p>

        <p>We further introduced <em>access duration</em> as a
        variable into logistic regression (see Table <a class="tbl"
        href="#tab3">3</a>). This is because we observed that the
        mean of the average access rates for accounts across
        languages varied: Greek accounts had the highest access
        times on average while English accounts had the lowest.
        This might indicate further activity such as text
        translation to facilitate navigation through the honey
        accounts. Logistic regression with access duration included
        among the discrete language variables was significant,
        accurately predicting 82.05% of criminal activity, and
        accounting for a small level of variance within the model
        (<em>z</em> = 2.17, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01). The access time
        variable also had a slight positive effect on the
        significance levels represented by Greek and English
        variables, with an English odds ratio of 0.8618208
        (<em>z</em> = 0.45, <em>p</em> = 0.656) and a Greek odds
        ratio of 2.345972 (<em>z</em> = 2.53, <em>p</em> &lt;
        0.01). However, the Romanian variable suffered a
        corresponding decrease (odds ratio 0.1589789) while still
        remaining significant (<em>z</em> = −6.56, <em>p</em> &lt;
        0.01).</p>

        <p>To re-affirm our findings, we mean-centred the access
        duration values before running the model again to ensure
        that the logistic model was not centring the access
        duration values at an intercept with a value of 0, but
        rather a value integral to the rest of the model (see Table
        <a class="tbl" href="#tab4">4</a>). Mean-centring had no
        effect on the fit of the model, other than marginally
        improving the significance of the Romanian language
        variable (<em>z</em> = −6.40, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01),
        resulting in the final odds ratio of 0.1084737.</p>
        <p>Since these results clearly demonstrate that there is a
        significant relationship between language and cybercriminal
        ability, we reject our null hypothesis <em>H</em>
        <sub>0</sub>. In the next section, we present our findings
        on the sensitive items that cybercriminals searched for
        within the honey accounts.</p>

        <p>We wanted to understand the themes and words that
        interest cybercriminals when they connect to compromised
        webmail accounts. Previous research has shown that one of
        the first steps of cybercriminals after compromising an
        online account is to assess its value by perusing its
        contents&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. This implies that they run search
        queries to isolate email messages of interest. However, we
        did not have access to search terms in the honey accounts
        since there is currently no API to retrieve such
        information from honey accounts. To overcome this
        limitation, we approximated the search terms by analyzing
        the opened emails and extracting important words from them,
        relative to all emails in the honey accounts. To achieve
        this, we relied on Term Frequency–Inverse Document
        Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis following the method outlined
        in previous work&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>].</p>
        <p>For each language set (English, Greek, Romanian), define
        <em>d<sub>R</sub></em> as the corpus of opened emails in
        the honey accounts of that language. Similarly, define
        <em>d<sub>A</sub></em> as the corpus of all emails in the
        inboxes of those accounts. Note that <em>d<sub>R</sub></em>
        is a subset of <em>d<sub>A</sub></em> . During
        preprocessing, we removed all words that had less than five
        characters from the corpus, and also removed signaling and
        header information. We obtained <sub><em>R</em></sub> and
        <sub><em>A</em></sub> as the resulting vectors of words and
        their probabilities after performing TF-IDF analysis on the
        text corpus [<em>d<sub>R</sub></em> ,
        <em>d<sub>A</sub></em> ]. We further computed the vector
        <sub><em>R</em></sub> − <sub><em>A</em></sub> . The idea is
        that words with higher <sub><em>R</em></sub> −
        <sub><em>A</em></sub> values have higher importance in the
        set of emails opened by miscreants, relative to the entire
        corpus. Thus, such words reveal the themes that miscreants
        were likely searching for.</p>

        show the results of TF-IDF analysis on English, Greek, and
        Romanian honey accounts respectively. They show that those
        who accessed the Greek and Romanian accounts attempted to
        search for words outside the linguistic confines of the
        accounts. For instance, the word “posted” appeared to be
        the most searched word in the Greek and Romanian accounts.
        The terms searched in the Romanian accounts did not include
        any financial or banking indicators, whereas the TF-IDF
        search approximation for the Greek accounts includes words
        such as τράπɛζας (bank) and κωδικός (code). Both words are
        among the sensitive terms that we used to seed the accounts
        beforehand. On a related note, financial terms such as
        “banking” and “investment” appear among the top TF-IDF
        words in the English accounts (see Table <a class="tbl"
        href="#tab5">5</a>). These findings show that
        cybercriminals indeed searched for financial terms in the
        honey accounts. This result is further strengthened by the
        observation that the terms found to be important in the
        entire email text <em>d<sub>A</sub></em> are not important
        in the corpus of opened emails <em>d<sub>R</sub></em> (as
        shown by the low <sub><em>R</em></sub> −
        <sub><em>A</em></sub> values, some of which are negative).
        This is a strong indicator that the opened emails were not
        selected randomly by cybercriminals; they were opened
        deliberately after searches were conducted for those terms.
        This corroborates findings in&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

      </header>
      <p><strong>Summary of findings.&nbsp;</strong> Contrary to
      our expectations, our findings show that cybercriminals are
      more likely to locate sensitive information in the Greek
      accounts than accounts in the other languages. This is rather
      intriguing since only two of the accesses originated from
      Greece or Greek-speaking countries. We recognize that some
      accesses to the accounts may have been made through proxy
      servers. However, it is clear that those who visited the
      accounts were not solely Greek-speaking individuals. These
      findings run contrary to the ideas espoused in theories of
      language comprehension and understanding which suggest that
      individuals should be significantly hindered in their
      comprehension if they do not understand the language of the
      object they are interacting with. Thus, we postulate that the
      cybercriminals possibly used online language translation
      tools to translate financial terms to Greek prior to
      searching the Greek accounts for such keywords. This would
      also explain the amount of time that they spent accessing the
      accounts: Greek accounts recorded longer access times than
      the rest, while English accounts recorded the lowest.</p>
      <p>Miscreants spent more time on average going through the
      Greek and Romanian accounts. This indicates a number of
      possibilities. As earlier stated, cybercriminals may spend
      more time on the accounts to incorporate the use of online
      translation services to improve their limited understanding
      of email content. Alternatively, it may be because
      individuals are more readily able to assess the contents of a
      webmail account whose language is English, and consequently
      disregard such an account if it appears to have limited
      value.</p>
      <p>Finally, the ability to search for keywords in the content
      of an email account may be a key factor in the ability of a
      criminal to traverse a compromised webmail account, as seen
      in our TF-IDF evaluation which highlighted words such as
      “bank” and “code.” This suggests that it might be possible
      for webmail service providers to hamper criminal elements
      from finding sensitive information in compromised accounts by
      obfuscating or removing banking and financial keywords.</p>
      <p><strong>Limitations.&nbsp;</strong> First, we were able to
      leak the honey accounts through paste sites only. Hence, our
      results may not reflect what happens to accounts that are
      compromised via other outlets. Second, our approach relies on
      TF-IDF to approximate search terms in the honey accounts. As
      a result, we only have insight into searches whose results
      were opened by the miscreants. We are unable to assess
      searches that did not return results and searches that
      returned results which the miscreants did not open.</p>
      <p><strong>Future work.&nbsp;</strong> In the future, we
      intend to explore the use of compromised online accounts in
      other scenarios, for instance, targeted attacks. We also
      intend to study the impact of language differentiation on
      cybercriminal activity on other platforms, for instance
      online social networks, cloud storage accounts, and online
      banking accounts.</p>

      <p>In this paper, we studied the impact of language
      differentiation on the activity of cybercriminals accessing
      compromised webmail accounts. We created, deployed, and
      leaked thirty honey accounts spanning three languages, namely
      English, Greek, and Romanian. We collected and analyzed data
      on accesses and activity from the honey accounts for . Our
      tests revealed a significant relationship between language
      and the ability of a cybercriminal to access a sensitive item
      (that we seeded the account with). We also found that
      cybercriminals searched for sensitive financial information
      in the accounts. Our findings will help the research
      community to gain deeper insight into the relationship
      between language and cybercriminal activity, and potentially
      provide insight into ways to develop effective techniques
      towards detecting illegitimate activity in online
      accounts.</p>
