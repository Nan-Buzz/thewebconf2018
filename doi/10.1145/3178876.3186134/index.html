        <p><small>Ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft have
        become an important part of the Vehicle For Hire (VFH)
        market, which used to be dominated by taxis. Unfortunately,
        ridesharing services are not required to share data like
        taxi services, which has made it challenging to compare the
        competitive dynamics of these services, or assess their
        impact on cities. In this paper, we comprehensively compare
        Uber, Lyft, and taxis with respect to key market features
        (supply, demand, price, and wait time) in San Francisco and
        New York City. Based on point pattern statistics, we
        develop novel statistical techniques to validate our
        measurement methods. Using spatial lag models, we
        investigate the accessibility of VFH services, and find
        that transportation infrastructure and socio-economic
        features have substantial effects on VFH market
        features.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>

      <p>Understanding transportation services is essential for a
      variety of critical tasks, ranging from urban planning and
      traffic engineering to economic and social mobility. Popular
      options for urban transportation include private vehicles,
      public transit, and Vehicle for Hire (VFH) services.
      Traditionally, the VFH market has been dominated by taxis;
      however it has recently undergone a dramatic shift due to the
      rise of the “sharing economy.” Today, ridesharing services
      such as Uber and Lyft augment taxi services in many cities.
      For example, the Treasurers Office of San Francisco estimates
      that there are over 45K Uber and Lyft drivers in San
      Francisco&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0044">44</a>], while the San Francisco Municipal
      Transportation Agency has issued only 2,026 taxi
      medallions&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. Similarly, in New York City, Uber
      and Lyft cars are now estimated to outnumber taxis 4 to
      1&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>].</p>
      <p>The taxi industry is heavily regulated to promote
      equitable pricing and access to services, while constraining
      their impact on infrastructure (e.g., congestion) and the
      environment. For example, in most cities taxi fare prices are
      set by law, taxi drivers are required to serve all areas of
      the city, and the total number of taxis is capped via a
      licensing regime (e.g., medallions). Furthermore, many cities
      require that taxi companies periodically report trip-level
      data to a regulatory agency, to increase transparency and
      ensure compliance with the law&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. In contrast, Uber and
      Lyft both set prices internally (often using opaque
      algorithms), they are not required to serve all areas of the
      city, and there are no limits on the total number of
      ridesharing vehicles. Additionally, ridesharing firms rarely
      reveal detailed data to regulators&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0043">43</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0046">46</a>].</p>
      <p>Given the increasing prominence of ridesharing services,
      and the lack of transparency surrounding their operations, it
      is crucial to understand how they compare to traditional
      taxis – and to each other. In this paper, we focus on issues
      of <em>competition</em> and <em>accessibility</em>, i.e., do
      Uber and Lyft offer equal levels of service in terms of
      <em>supply</em> and <em>price</em> throughout a given city?
      Furthermore, do they offer equivalent levels of service to
      traditional taxis? If not, are there associations between the
      features of different neighborhoods (e.g., median household
      incoming, racial/ethic demographics, or access to public
      transportation) and the observed levels of service? The
      answers to these questions are critical for urban planners
      and regulators, as well as to customers of ridesharing
      services.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we take a comprehensive look at the
      competition and accessibility of Uber, Lyft, and taxis in 2
      major U.&nbsp;S. cities. We collect ride-level traces from
      Uber and Lyft vehicles in San Francisco County (SF) for 40
      days, and compare them to corresponding taxi ride traces from
      the same time period. We also collect and analyze 27 days of
      Uber and Lyft traces from New York City (NYC). Based on this
      dataset, we make the following contributions:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="•">We present the first head-to-head
        spatial and temporal comparisons of VFH services. This
        includes a key finding that 1–3% of ridesharing drivers are
        active on Uber and Lyft simultaneously. In addition, we
        provide independent validation of key results from prior
        work on equitability and utilization of ridesharing
        services&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        features (e.g., supply and demand) than population density,
        highlighting the interdependence of ridesharing with
        existing infrastructure. For socio-economic features, we
        observe that “whiter” neighborhoods in SF and “richer”
        neighborhoods in NYC have significant effects on supply and
        demand of ridesharing services, although we caution that
        the effect sizes are small.<br /></li>

      <p>There is an emerging body of scholarship on ridesharing
      services. Lee&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. surveyed Uber drivers to
      understand how they interact with the
      platform&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>], while Guo&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. surveyed
      passengers to understand why they choose to use
      ridesharing&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>].</p>
      <p>Much of the existing literature focuses on the dynamic
      “surge pricing” systems used by many ridesharing platforms.
      Uber has been involved in several studies that present
      positive outcomes from surge pricing, including increased
      supply of drivers&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>], increased consumer
      surplus&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>], and a decrease in “wild goose
      chase” passenger pickups&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. In contrast, Chen&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.
      presented the first independent evaluation of Uber's surge
      pricing system, and found that it was less effective at
      increasing driver supply than reducing passenger
      demand&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>].
      Guo&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. used data from Didi (the most popular
      ridesharing service in China) to analyze the relationship
      between demand and dynamic prices&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>], while
      Kooti&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. used email receipts to examine
      correlations between passenger demographics and willingness
      to pay surge prices&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0032">32</a>].</p>
      <p><strong>Competition with Taxis.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Another line of scholarship
      investigates competition between ridesharing and taxis.
      Gloss&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. and McGregor&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. studied
      Uber's impact on the taxi business by interviewing drivers in
      London and San Francisco&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>]. Cramer&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. found that
      capacity utilization was higher with Uber than taxis,
      possibly due to Uber's centralized, app-based dispatch
      system&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>].
      The different pricing models between Uber and taxis have led
      researchers to develop price comparison apps to help
      passengers minimize travel costs&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0047">47</a>].</p>
      <p>One notable shortcoming of this body of work is that it
      tends to focus on only Uber, yet ridesharing markets in many
      countries are oligopolies&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>], typically between Uber and Lyft in
      the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>].</p>
      <p><strong>Accessibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Several
      studies have focused on accessibility and discrimination in
      the gig-economy&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>]. Ge&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. found that
      ridesharing drivers sometimes discriminated against
      minorities&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>], echoing similar studies on taxi
      drivers&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0039">39</a>]. We investigate whether patterns of
      discrimination are discernible at the level of whole
      cities.</p>
      <p>Thebault-Spieker&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. used a Durbin model to
      examine how population demographics in Chicago affects wait
      times for Uber&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>]; they found no significant direct
      effects between income and waiting time. We conduct similar
      experiments in SF and NYC. However, we view wait times as a
      proxy for more fundamental market features (i.e., supply,
      demand, and price) that we focus on in this study.
      Additionally, case studies on taxi mobility patterns have
      been conducted in Manhattan, NYC&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>] and Shanghai,
      China&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>].</p>
      <p><strong>Regulation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The sudden
      and massive popularity of ridesharing, coupled with the lack
      of transparency exhibited by ridesharing services, has led to
      calls for regulation. Calo and Rosenblat argue that
      information asymmetry gives ridesharing firms a structural
      advantage against passengers and drivers, and thus they must
      be regulated&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. Edelman&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. and
      Posen&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. discuss potential solutions for
      regulating Uber&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>]. Rogers argues that there may be
      pro-social benefits if ridesharing services can be properly
      regulated, although they may simultaneously have a
      deleterious impact on low-wage workers&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0045">45</a>].</p>
      <p>One potential reason to regulate ridesharing services is
      to compel them to serve all areas of cities equally, as taxis
      are often required to do. We aim to inform this debate by
      examining the accessibility of Uber and Lyft vehicles
      throughout SF and NYC. Although ridesharing companies have
      shared data publicly in the past&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

        </figure><strong>Uber and Lyft.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We collected data from Uber and
        Lyft using their apps&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. In brief, we recorded the network
        requests made by Uber and Lyft's smartphone apps for
        passengers, as well as responses from the servers. To
        render the onscreen maps with available cars, the apps made
        requests to the server every five seconds with the user's
        latitude and longitude; the servers responded with a
        message that included (1) the GPS coordinates of the eight
        nearest available cars to the user, (2) the current surge
        price, and (3) the estimated wait time for a ride at the
        requested location. The data includes a unique ID for each
        car, as well as each car's trajectory for the past few
        seconds.
        <p></p>
        <p>We created a script that sent the same messages to Uber
        and Lyft's servers as the passenger apps, and recorded the
        responses. We can specify the GPS coordinates sent by our
        script, which gave us the ability to collect data at any
        location. We collect information for large areas by
        “blanketing” them with multiple emulated users. We selected
        the GPS coordinates for each measurement point such that it
        had a large overlap of the eight nearest cars with the
        adjacent measurement points, even during rush hour (when
        the supply of Uber and Lyft cars peaks&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]), so that we did not
        miss any cars.</p>
        <p>The black dots in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig1">1</a> show the placement of our measurement points
        for Uber and Lyft. Note that we placed our measurement
        points more densely in high-traffic portions of each city,
        to ensure full coverage of cars. In SF, our emulated users
        covered the entire county; in NYC, we covered all of
        Manhattan and Staten Island (not shown in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>), the west
        parts of the Bronx, and the northwest parts of Queens and
        Brooklyn. We collected data continuously from November 12
        to December 22, 2016 in SF, and from February 1 to February
        27, 2017 in NYC.</p>
        <p><strong>Taxi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The SFCTA
        provided trip-level taxi records from the greater San
        Francisco area covering November 1 to December 30, 2016.
        These records contain, for each taxi: its medallion number,
        its GPS trace while it is in service, and its occupancy
        (i.e., when it has a passenger). However, not all taxi
        companies reported their data to the SFCTA. The dataset
        contains 554 unique taxi medallions, which represents 27%
        of the 2,026 medallions that the city has
        issued&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. To estimate the entire taxi
        ecosystem, we assume that the behavior of the missing taxis
        follow similar distributions to the ones in our dataset.
        Thus, we estimate taxi supply and demand by multiplying the
        empirical counts from our dataset by 2026/554 = 3.65.</p>
        <p>Although there is taxi data available from NYC during
        our measurement interval, it only contains pickup and
        dropoff points, rather than GPS traces&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. This limitation
        precludes us from using the NYC taxi data in this
        study.</p>

        <p>Next, we discuss how we prepared our Uber, Lyft, and
        taxi datasets for analysis. Preprocessing is necessary
        because the information that is available to us from each
        service is different, and we need to infer market features
        to understand competition.</p>

            Each dot represents a GPS coordinate we observe. For
            Uber and Lyft, we do not observe the cars when they are
            carrying riders. With Uber, cars are also assigned a
            new ID each time they pick up a rider.</span>
          </div>
        </figure><strong>Building Trajectories.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> First, we compute the
        <em>trajectories</em> for each car in our dataset, which
        are a series of geolocations indexed by time.
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a> illustrates
        the trajectories we can build for cars from each service.
        For Uber, car IDs in our dataset are transient: each car is
        assigned a unique ID each time it becomes available to
        accept a ride request. Therefore, we record vehicle
        trajectories when the drivers are waiting for ride
        requests. For Lyft, car IDs in our dataset are persistent,
        i.e., we observed a unique ID for each vehicle that existed
        for the entirety of our data collection period; others have
        also observed this behavior&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>]. We split the temporal
        datastream for a given Lyft vehicle into trajectories by
        looking for “gaps” of over 60 seconds. During our
        observation period, more than 99.9% of time gaps for Lyft
        vehicles were less than 10 seconds, thus we treat large 60
        seconds gaps as a signal indicating that a driver accepted
        a ride request or went offline. For taxis, our dataset
        contains persistent IDs for drivers and explicit indicators
        of when each taxi is occupied. Thus, splitting the taxi
        datastreams into trajectories is trivial.
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Inferring Supply, Demand, and Price.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Next, we extract three key
        features that we use to analyze the VFH market:
        <em>supply</em>, <em>demand</em>, and <em>price</em>. To
        make our data comparable across VFH services, we
        discretized all timestamps into a series of five-minute
        time slots. Furthermore, we group all precise geolocations
        into <em>block groups</em>, which are geostatistical map
        partitions used by the U.&nbsp;S. Census&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] and the
        American Community Survey (ACS)&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>].</p>
        <p>Supply is defined as the total amount of a specific good
        or service that is available to consumers. We measure
        supply as <em>the number of available cars</em> in a block
        group at a given time. One potential concern is the case
        when a driver accepts a ride request and is on their way to
        pick up the rider. Such a car should not count towards
        supply. Fortunately, both Uber and Lyft drivers disappear
        from the set of available cars (and our dataset) once they
        accept a ride request. Similarly, in our taxi data, taxis
        that are on their way to pick up a rider are also labeled
        as being unavailable during this time. Another issue
        concerns Uber specifically. Uber has an internal tool known
        as <em>greyballing</em> that allows them to send fake data
        to specific users&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>]. In §&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
        "#sec-7">3.3</a>, we use statistical tests to determine,
        with high confidence, that our Uber dataset is not subject
        to greyballing.</p>
        <p>Demand is defined as consumers’ desire and willingness
        to pay a price for a specific good or service. In the VFH
        context, this means the number of consumers who want to pay
        for a ride. We are unable to measure this from a
        passenger's perspective (as we cannot observe users who
        request rides from Uber and Lyft), but we can infer when a
        car picks up a rider (as the car will disappear from the
        set of available cars). We therefore define demand in our
        context as <em>the number of fulfilled trips</em>, and
        measure it as <em>the number of disappearing cars</em> in a
        block group during a five-minute time slot.</p>
        <p>There are several challenges when measuring demand on
        Uber and Lyft: <em>first</em>, when a car disappears, it is
        possible that the driver logged off, rather than picked up
        a rider; we expect this case to be infrequent compared to
        the number of ride requests. However, means that our
        estimates of demand on Uber and Lyft should be interpreted
        as upper bounds. <em>Second</em>, a car can also disappear
        from our dataset if it drives outside of our measurement
        area; we handle this case by detecting cars at the very
        edge of our measurement area and not counting them as
        demand&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>].</p>
        <p>The market price is defined as the current price at
        which an asset or service can be bought. In the VFH
        context, we use the average surge price in a block group
        over the five-minute window as the price for Uber and Lyft.
        Taxi prices are fixed by law.</p>

        <p>As noted above, there are limitations to our measurement
        methods, especially when inferring demand. To determine
        whether our methods are able to accurately capture supply
        and demand for Uber and Lyft, we validate our dataset
        against a ground-truth dataset containing the pickup
        locations (i.e., demand) for Uber and Lyft vehicles in
        Manhattan from April to September 2014&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

        this ground-truth data directly from Uber and Lyft.</p>
        <p>To validate our dataset, we aim to test the null

        high-level approach is to find an appropriate statistical
        measure to capture the spatial dependency between
        <em>P<sub>m</sub></em> and <em>P<sub>g</sub></em> , then
        compare the dependency of <em>P<sub>m</sub></em> and

        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$K_{P_m
        P_g}$</span></span> is inefficient because of the large
        size of our datasets. Instead, we estimate <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$K_{P_m
        P_g}$</span></span> asymptotically using a Monte Carlo
        approach, i.e., we repeatedly resample <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$P^*_m$</span></span>
        from <em>P<sub>m</sub></em> and <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$P^*_g$</span></span>
        from <em>P<sub>g</sub></em> , and compute <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$K_{P^*_m
        P^*_g}$</span></span> . Finally, we can use its expectation
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$K_{P_m
        P_g} = \mathbb {E}(K_{P^*_m P^*_g})$</span></span> . Since
        we care about the distribution of <em>K</em> rather than
        its specific value, we set <em>α</em> = 1 for simplicity.
        <p></p>
        <p>The <em>K</em> function counts the number of points from
        one distribution found within a given search radius of each
        point of another distribution. Thus, it is used to measure
        the dependency of two spatial samples. <em>K</em> increases
        with search radius <em>t</em>; when <em>t</em> is fixed, a
        larger <em>K</em> represents stronger dependency between
        the two point patterns. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig3">3</a> shows the value of <em>K</em> as we vary
        <em>t</em> for Uber and Lyft; the three lines correspond to
        <em>P<sub>g</sub></em> compared to <em>P<sub>g</sub></em> ,
        <em>P<sub>m</sub></em> , and a randomly generated point
        pattern. Intuitively, The dashed lines represent the upper
        and lower bounds for <em>K</em>. The solid
        <em>P<sub>g</sub></em> versus <em>P<sub>m</sub></em> lines
        are very close to the upper bound, thus implying high
        similarity between the point distributions.</p>
        <p><strong>Methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> We adopt a
        Monte Carlo method to test hypothesis <em>H</em>
        <sub>0</sub>. First, we create the empirical point pattern
        <em>P</em> = <em>P<sub>m</sub></em> ∪<em>P<sub>g</sub></em>
        , then in each iteration we randomly choose two new samples
        <em>P<sub>i</sub></em> and <em>P<sub>j</sub></em> from
        <em>P</em> with |<em>P<sub>i</sub></em> | =
        |<em>P<sub>m</sub></em> | and |<em>P<sub>j</sub></em> | =
        |<em>P<sub>g</sub></em> |. This relabeling process
        simulates the point generation process of
        <em>P<sub>m</sub></em> and <em>P<sub>g</sub></em> . Next,
        we compute <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$K_{P_i P_j}$</span></span> repeatedly to form an
        empirical distribution <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathbb {P}(K_{P_i

        <p>As our methodology collected data from real VFH

        ethical standards. First, we did not collect <em>any</em>
        personal information about any Uber, Lyft, or taxi drivers
        or passengers; all of the identifiers we collect are opaque
        IDs. Second, we minimized our impact on Uber and Lyft's
        infrastructure: our script for collecting data had the same
        behavior as these services’ smartphone apps, and did not
        collect data more aggressively than the app itself would.
        Third, we never requested rides from Uber or Lyft, and
        drivers are not able to observe our measurement clients in
        the driver apps. Thus, our data collection should have no
        impact on VFH drivers, riders, or services.</p>

        <p>To compare the VFH services over time, we aggregate
        information about supply and demand across all block
        groups. For price, we compute the average price across all
        block groups.</p>
        <p><strong>Supply and Demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>&nbsp;(a–d)
        presents the aggregate supply and demand in SF and NYC for
        each of the three services during a sample of six days from
        our measurements. We present data averaged over five minute
        and two hour windows. The anomalies on February 5, 2017 in
        NYC show a sudden drop in supply and increase in demand,
        and corresponding increase in price; we hypothesize that
        these were caused by the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>We immediately make a number of observations.
        <em>First</em>, we observe similar periodic fluctuations
        for both supply and demand for Uber and Lyft: on weekdays
        there are two daily peaks corresponding to morning and
        evening rush hour. On weekends (shaded grey), there is only
        one peak per day, typically around noon. On holidays (e.g.,
        Thanksgiving, not shown), there is much lower supply and
        demand, with no particular peaks. Overall, we observe
        strong correlation between the supply for Uber and Lyft
        (Pearson <em>r</em> = 0.90 for SF, <em>r</em> = 0.91 for
        NYC, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) as well as demand (Pearson
        <em>r</em> = 0.94 for SF, <em>r</em> = 0.92 for NYC,
        <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p>
        <p><em>Second</em>, we observe that the daily patterns of
        supply and demand are different for taxis in SF. The supply
        for taxis maintains a similar pattern every day, and
        exhibits less variance throughout the day; although there
        are roughly twice as many Ubers on the road during rush
        hour, there are often more taxis on the road at night. We
        attribute these differences between taxis and Uber/Lyft to
        different employment mechanisms, i.e., Uber/Lyft drivers
        are considered to be independent contractors and have more
        freedom to choose when they work. When comparing taxis to
        Uber and Lyft, we observe relatively weak correlations with
        supply (Pearson <em>r</em> = 0.58 for Uber/Taxi, <em>r</em>
        = 0.53 for Lyft/Taxi, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) and demand
        (Pearson <em>r</em> = 0.62 for Uber/Taxi, <em>r</em> = 0.58
        for Lyft/Taxi, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p>
        <p><em>Third</em>, we observe that Uber has 2–2.5 × more
        supply and demand than Lyft. In contrast, the supply of
        Lyfts and taxis is similar, but the demand for taxis is
        significantly lower.</p>
        <p><strong>Utilization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> These
        findings suggest that taxis spend more time waiting for a
        rider than Uber and Lyft. To explore differences in
        utilization, we computed the cumulative distribution of
        idle time (i.e., how long cars spend waiting for a rider)
        for each service in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig5">5</a>&nbsp;(a–b). Uber and Lyft show median idle
        times of roughly 1 minute, versus roughly 10 minutes for
        taxis. On average, we found that Lyft drivers spend 19% of
        their time idling, while taxis spend 48%. These findings
        hold even when we examine the idle time distributions at
        different times of the day in SF (Figure&nbsp;<a class=
        "fig" href="#fig5">5</a>&nbsp;(c)). These results provide
        independent confirmation of those from
        Cramer&nbsp;et&nbsp;al., who also found (using proprietary
        data provided by Uber) that Uber vehicles have higher
        utilization than taxis&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>].</p>
        <p><strong>Price. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> We now
        examine how the citywide average price changes over time.
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>&nbsp;(e–f)
        shows the average surge price for all three services during
        one week of our measurements. The taxi price line is always
        one (as taxi services do not implement surge pricing).
        Although we see that prices are very noisy for Uber and
        Lyft, there is strong and significant correlation between
        these two time series (Pearson <em>r</em> = 0.82 for SF,
        <em>r</em> = 0.89 for NYC, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). This
        suggests that even though Uber and Lyft's dynamic pricing
        algorithms may be implemented differently, they both
        respond similarly to changes in citywide supply and demand,
        when aggregated temporally.</p>

        <p>Next, we analyze the spatial dynamics of VFH services by
        calculating the average supply, demand, and price per block
        group.</p>
        <p><strong>Supply and Demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a> shows the
        aggregated supply for Uber, Lyft, and taxi services across
        SF and NYC, where the color represents the average amount
        of supply in each block group. We observe that aggregate
        supply follows a similar geospatial distribution across all
        three services: most vehicles are available downtown (i.e.,
        near Financial Street in SF and Downtown/Midtown in NYC),
        and gradually decrease as one moves further from the urban
        core. Overall, we observed very high similarity across
        services (Pearson <em>r</em> &gt; 0.95 for Uber/Lyft for
        supply in both cities, and <em>r</em> &gt; 0.80 for
        Ridesharing/Taxi in SF, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). We observe
        that demand follows corresponding trends in both cities.
        Similar results for Uber vehicles have been observed by
        Chen&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

        <p>Although we observe similar <em>aggregate</em> patterns
        for supply across the three VFH services, this does not
        tell us whether <em>individual car</em> patterns are the
        same, i.e., what fraction of the city do individual drivers
        serve? This is a critical question, since regulated taxi
        services are required to serve all areas of the city by
        law, but ridesharing services are not.</p>

        </figure>
        <p></p>
        <p>To answer this question, we focus on Lyft and taxis in
        SF (since Lyft car IDs are persistent), and plot the
        cumulative distribution of the number of unique block
        groups that each car visits in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig"
        href="#fig7">7</a>&nbsp;(b). To make the comparison fair,
        we only examine the 45% of Lyfts and 87% of taxis that we
        are able to observe for ≥ 30 days (see
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a>&nbsp;(a)).
        These “full-time” drivers should have ample time over the
        course of 30 days to drive through the majority of the
        city.</p>
        <p>As shown in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig7">7</a>&nbsp;(b), the median number of visited block
        groups for full-time Lyft cars is 261, versus 503 for
        taxis. There are 580 block groups in SF, meaning each taxi
        tends to service the whole city, while the majority of Lyft
        vehicles serve less than half of the city. However, we
        caution that this result should not be interpreted to mean
        that Lyft as a whole does not serve all of SF. One possible
        interpretation of this observation is that Lyft's
        centralized, computerized dispatch system enables their
        fleet to more efficiently service the whole city than
        taxis, even though individual Lyft drivers have small
        coverage areas. We explore this topic in more detail in
        §&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-13">5</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Price. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Finally, we
        examine the average price for each block group as shown in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>. We observe
        some similarity between Uber and Lyft: for example, both
        show the highest prices in the northeastern region and the
        lowest pricing in the southwestern region in SF. However,
        the correlation between Uber and Lyft's prices (Pearson
        <em>r</em> = 0.67 for SF and <em>r</em> = 0.57 for NYC,
        <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) is weaker than for supply and
        demand.</p>
        <p>We do observe a number of distinctions between Uber and
        Lyft's pricing. <em>First</em>, Uber seems to surge prices
        relatively gradually over large areas, while Lyft generates
        higher prices in very specific neighborhoods, such as South
        of Market, the Castro, Haight-Ashbury, and Laguna Honda
        Hospital in SF. These results suggest that Uber and Lyft's
        algorithms use different approaches to calculate spatial
        surge prices. We also note that Uber's algorithm has
        changed significantly since Chen&nbsp;et&nbsp;al. examined
        it in 2015&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. <em>Second</em>, Lyft has higher
        median/peak surges on average (1.08/1.23, s.d. 0.056 in SF;
        1.04/1.14, s.d. 0.025 in NYC) than Uber (1.07/1.12, s.d.
        0.029 in SF; 1.02/1.03, s.d. 0.007 in NYC).</p>

        <p>Prior work has presented anecdotal evidence that some
        drivers are active on Uber and Lyft
        simultaneously&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>], even though both companies forbid
        this&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>]. However, no one has attempted to
        quantify the number of “shared” drivers. Identifying such
        drivers is important, since they are effectively being
        double-counted in the VFH supply, and therefore helps us to
        understand the competition between Uber and Lyft.</p>
        <p>We identify shared drivers by comparing vehicle
        trajectories across our three services. Intuitively, if a
        driver is available on Uber and Lyft simultaneously (e.g.,
        by running their driver apps concurrently, or by using two
        smartphones), we will observe an Uber and a Lyft vehicle
        with temporally and spatially coincident
        trajectories<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
        "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Furthermore, when a shared
        driver accepts a request from one service, they will need
        to immediately log-out of the other service, lest they
        receive another ride request.</p>
        <p><strong>Methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> To identify
        coincident Uber and Lyft vehicle trajectories, we use the
        following procedure. We convert the GPS coordinates in each
        trajectory to block groups and timestamps to 5-minute
        windows, to deal with the inherent inaccuracies of GPS
        reports. Now that we have a sequence of time-associated
        block groups <em>B</em> = (<em>t</em> <sub>1</sub>,
        <em>b</em> <sub>1</sub>) → … → (<em>t</em>
        <sub>|<em>B</em>|</sub>, <em>b</em>
        <sub>|<em>B</em>|</sub>) that a car went though, let
        <em>B<sub>l</sub></em> and <em>B<sub>u</sub></em> be the
        trajectories of a given Lyft and Uber car, respectively. We
        detect shared drivers by calculating the Longest Common
        Subsequence <em>B<sub>LCS</sub></em> between
        <em>B<sub>l</sub></em> and <em>B<sub>u</sub></em> , while
        noting that the subsequence is not required to occupy
        consecutive positions in the block group sequence, since
        occasionally there are outliers in reported GPS coordinates
        that map to incorrect block groups. We consider
        <em>B<sub>l</sub></em> and <em>B<sub>u</sub></em> to be the
        same driver if |<em>B<sub>LCS</sub></em> | ≥ ϵ ×
        min {<em>c</em>, |<em>B<sub>l</sub></em> |,
        |<em>B<sub>u</sub></em> |}, where ϵ determines the required
        similarity threshold, and <em>c</em> bounds the minimum
        block groups required in the sequences so as to avoid
        trivial matches.</p>

        3.39% in SF (0/8.81%, s.d. 1.42%) and 1.32% in NYC
        (0/3.01%, s.d. 0.39%). Using the same methods, we find only
        0.17% of shared drivers between taxis and ridesharing cars
        in SF. Given the prior knowledge that taxi drivers cannot
        work for ridesharing companies, this suggests that the
        margin of error in our analysis is small.

      <p>In this section we address the question: <em>are VFH
      services equally accessible throughout cities?</em> As shown
      in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>, the supply
      and price for VFH services are heterogeneous across block
      groups; we observe that demand is equally heterogeneous. To
      better understand this heterogeneity, we fit models using the
      characteristics of the VFH services as dependent variables,
      and citywide features as independent variables,
      including:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list5" label="•">Transportation infrastructure
        features, e.g., public transit stops, on-street parking
        meters, off-street parking lots, etc.<br /></li>
        <li id="list6" label="•">Socio-economic features, e.g.,
        population density, ethnicity, income, education,
        etc.<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The former set of features are important from a civil
      engineering perspective: we seek to understand how VFH
      services interact with the existing transportation
      infrastructure in cities. The second set of features are
      important for equitability: by law, taxis must often serve
      all areas of cities, while no such requirements apply to Uber
      and Lyft. This raises the possibility that ridesharing
      services may exhibit discriminatory service patterns.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Our first task is selecting an appropriate model for our
        VFH data. We have found significant spatial autocorrelation
        between block groups for both supply and demand in SF and
        NYC (Moran's <em>I</em> test, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Such
        endogeneity makes Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear
        regression inappropriate because the estimated coefficients
        would overstate the real effects due to the spatial
        endogeneity.</p>
        <p>Instead, we adopt a <em>spatial lag model</em> that
        takes spatial dependencies into
        consideration&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]. The model is specified as:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="Xeq2">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} y = \rho
            \mathbf {W} y + \mathbf {\beta } \mathbf {X} + \epsilon
            , \epsilon \sim \mathbb {N}(0, \sigma ^ 2)
            \end{equation}</span><br />
            <span class="equation-number">(2)</span>
          </div>
        </div>where <em>y</em> is a market features (supply,
        demand, price, or wait time), <strong>X</strong> = (1,
        <em>X</em> <sub>1</sub>, <em>X</em> <sub>2</sub>, …) are
        citywide features of interest (note that we add a constant
        in the vector), and <strong><em>β</em></strong> is the
        coefficient vector. <strong>W</strong> <em>y</em> is the
        endogenous term, and its coefficient <em>ρ</em> explains
        the effect size of spatial dependency. This model is
        generally estimated by Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods.
        <p></p>
        <p>Unlike linear regression without endogeneity, the
        coefficient <em>β</em> in a spatial model is not directly
        interpretable because spatial endogeneity generates
        spillovers, i.e., the changes in an independent variable
        anywhere will affect the value of the dependent variable
        everywhere&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]. Instead, there are two kinds of
        related effects associated with independent variables:</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list7" label="•"><em>Direct effects</em> capture
          the impact of an independent variable in a specific
          location on the dependent variable in that same
          location.<br /></li>
          <li id="list8" label="•"><em>Indirect effects</em>
          capture the impact of an independent variable in a
          specific location on the dependent variable in all other
          locations.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, we can estimate the direct effect that
        median income in a block group has on supply in that block
        group, as well as the indirect effect that it has on supply
        in all other block groups. Summing these effects gives us
        the <em>total effect</em> for an independent variable in a
        given location. Furthermore, since each block group has its
        own direct and indirect effects, it is often necessary in
        practice to present <em>average effects</em> over the whole
        study area.</p>
        <p><strong>Independent Variables.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> We gather data for the
        independent variables in our models from several sources.
        For socio-economic data, we rely on the ACS&nbsp;[<a class=

        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. For

        Data Platform&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>] and the New York City Department

        groups to match the geospatial granularity of our VFH
        data.</p>
        <p><strong>Model Fitting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> In
        our experiments, we fit models for supply, demand, and
        price for Uber and Lyft in SF and NYC, as well as models
        for supply and demand for taxis in SF. As a direct
        comparison to Thebault-Spieker&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.
        &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>], we also repeat their experiments
        for waiting time. The resulting models are shown in
        Tables&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a>
        and&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a>. Our supply and
        demand models are fit to data at the block group-level. Our
        price and wait time models are fit to the observed values
        at each measurement point, coupled with socio-economic and
        transport data from the block group containing each
        measurement point. The differing granularity of the models
        explains why they have different sample sizes. Note that
        even though price and waiting time have weak spatial
        endogeneity, we still choose the spatial lag model over OLS
        as a precaution.</p>
        <p>During model fitting, we iteratively removed features to
        reduce the effects of multicollinearity. The final models
        all have conditional number test <em>c</em> &lt; 30, which
        is considered acceptable&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>].</p>
        <p><strong>Diagnostics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> We
        evaluate the goodness-of-fit of our models before examining
        specific coefficients. We observe that all supply and
        demand models have <em>R</em> <sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.71,
        indicating a strong fit. Additionally, the spatial weight
        terms are significant (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), which
        indicates strong spatial dependency. In contrast, the wait
        time models are not as strongly fit (<em>R</em>
        <sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.36) and not spatially dependent. The price
        models have the weakest fit, especially in NYC (<em>R</em>
        <sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.36 in SF, <em>R</em> <sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.02
        in NYC).</p>

        <p>We now examine how VFH market features are affected by
        the number of public transit stops, on-street parking
        meters, and off-street parking lots per block group.</p>
        <p><strong>Supply and Demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        In SF and NYC, we observe highly significant (<em>p</em>
        &lt; 0.001), positive total effects of the number of
        parking meters and lots on VFH supply/demand. The sizes of
        the coefficients tend to be the same order of magnitude
        across Uber, Lyft, and taxi. The number of public transit
        stops has somewhat significant (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05),
        positive effects on supply in SF, and highly significant
        (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01), positive effects on demand in SF.
        However, public transit stops do not have a significant
        effect in NYC. Overall, a 1% increase in off-street parking
        increases the expected number of Ubers, Lyfts, and taxis by
        0.12%, 0.1%, and 0.28% in SF, and the number of Ubers and
        Lyfts by 0.07% and 0.06% in NYC.</p>
        <p>To make these findings concrete, we plot the
        <em>individual effect</em> sizes of the off-street parking
        feature on supply and demand in Figures&nbsp;9
        and&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig9">10</a> for SF and NYC.
        The dark bars show the direct effects on the given area,
        while the light bars show the indirect effects on the rest
        of the city. We focus on four Communities of Concern
        (COC)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] in each city. Bay Area COC are
        defined by the California Metropolitan Transportation
        Commission based on eight variables drawn from ACS data,
        including poverty levels, ethnicity, etc. We used the same
        thresholds to identify COC around NYC. To make the effect
        sizes comparable across features with different units, we
        present <em>elasticities</em> when analyzing individual
        effects, i.e., the percent changes of dependent variables
        due to a 1% change in an independent variables.</p>
        <p>We draw three observations from Figures&nbsp;9
        and&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig9">10</a>. First, as
        expected, the direct effect is always much larger than the
        indirect effect. Second, the effect size in terms of
        elasticities is larger in areas with fewer parking meters
        (e.g., Chinatown versus South of Market). Third, although
        the effect sizes vary by area, in all cases we see that
        demand increases more than supply.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results highlight the
        interdependence of transportation infrastructure and VFH
        services. We hypothesize that parking meters and (costly)
        off-street parking lots encourage people to opt for VFH
        services rather than using their own vehicles. With respect
        to transit stops in SF, it is unclear why more stops
        corresponds to more supply and demand. One possibility is
        that VFH services are being used for “last-mile” services,
        e.g., getting commuters from transit hubs to their homes.
        Alternatively, it is possible that people are eschewing
        public transit options that are perceived as inconvient for
        more convenient VFH services. This latter hypothesis is
        supported by surveys of riders&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

        <p><strong>Price and Wait Time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        Tables&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a>
        and&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a> show that
        transportation infrastructure features have essentially no
        effects on surge prices, but some effects on wait times. In
        SF, although some of the price coefficients are significant
        (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01), their magnitude is extremely small,
        meaning there is little impact in practice. Wait times in
        SF and NYC are significant (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) and
        positive with respect to public transit stops, but
        significant (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05 in SF) and negative with
        respect to parking features. Our wait time results match
        those from prior work on Uber&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>].</p>
        <p><strong>Population Density. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        One important question is whether population density
        explains the association we observe between VFH market
        features and transportation infrastructure. For example, we
        would expect there to be more transit stops in highly
        populated areas, which might also correspond to a large
        demand for VFH services. However, our models include
        population density, and we see that it has mixed effects on
        VFH market features (sometimes positive, sometimes
        negative). Furthermore, we find that population density is
        negatively affected by transportation infrastructure
        features (e.g., Pearsons <em>r</em> = −0.28 for public
        transit stops and <em>r</em> = −0.16 for off-street parking
        lots, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001, in SF). Thus, we conclude that
        transportation infrastructure does have strong and distinct
        effects on VFH market dynamics, independent of population
        density.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Next, we examine the effect of urban socio-economics on
        VFH market features.</p>
        <p><strong>Family Ratio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The
        family ratio is the fraction households in a block group
        containing families&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. Since this feature is not
        sensitive, we examine it first and treat it as a baseline
        when discussing more sensitive socio-economic features.</p>
        <p>As shown in Tables&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
        "#tab1">1</a> and&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a>,
        the family ratio has highly significant (<em>p</em> &lt;
        0.001) effects on almost all VFH market features across all
        three services in both cities. As the family ratio
        increases, supply and demand decrease, while wait times
        increase, and in SF prices increase. Figures&nbsp;9
        and&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig9">10</a> show that the
        effect size for the family ratio can be large: for example,
        in Hunter's Point and Red Hook, an increase in the number
        of families by 1% would reduce supply and demand by 1–8%.
        We hypothesize that the strong effects of the number of
        families on VFH market features are caused by (1) the need
        for families to own private cars and (2) the prevalence of
        families in the suburban periphery of cities.</p>
        <p><strong>Ethnicity in SF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        Next we examine ethnicity, which we encode as the number of
        individuals who self-identify as white or caucasian per
        block group. We do not observe significant effects in NYC,
        but do in SF. Specifically, we observe significant
        (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05), positive effects of the number of
        white individuals on supply/demand for Ubers and Lyfts, but
        significant (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), negative effects on
        supply/demand for taxis. While these effects are troubling
        and consistent across block groups in SF (see
        Figure&nbsp;9), we caution that the effect size is small:
        as shown in Figure&nbsp;9, even in areas of SF with large
        minority populations like Excelsior and Hunter's Point, a
        1% increase in the number of white residents would only
        increase supply/demand for ridesharing by &lt; 1%. Contrast
        this to the much larger effect sizes for changes in the
        family ratio. Furthermore, Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
        "#tab1">1</a> shows that the number of white individuals
        does not significantly affect price or wait time in SF (or
        NYC), so we cannot conclude that minority areas of SF are
        being substantively disadvantaged by the lower supply of
        ridesharing vehicles.</p>
        <p>It is unclear why the fraction of white residents in SF
        has different effects on ridesharing and taxi ridership.
        One possibility is that systematic discrimination by
        ridesharing drivers that has been observed by prior audits
        studies&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>] has trained ethnic minority
        passengers to rely on taxis instead. However, this
        hypothesis belies similar, well-documented discrimination
        by taxi drivers&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0039">39</a>]. Another possible explanation is
        that because the law stipulates that taxis must serve all
        areas of the city, taxi drivers have been trained to visit
        more diverse areas than ridesharing drivers. Given that
        there is a small positive correlation between the number of
        white residents per block group and transportation
        infrastructure in SF (Pearson <em>r</em> = 0.15 for public
        transit stops, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), the negative
        coefficient may essentially be compensation for less
        transportation infrastructure in minority communities.</p>
        <p><strong>Income in NYC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        Finally, we examine the effects of median income on VFH
        market features. We do not observe significant effects in
        SF, but do observe significant (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01),
        positive effects on supply in NYC. However, similar to
        ethnicity, the sizes of the “wealth” effect are small:
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig9">10</a> shows that a
        1% increase in median income only increases supply and
        demand for ridesharing by &lt; 1%, although this effect is
        consistent across block groups. We do not observe
        significant effects of median income on price in NYC, and
        only weak effects on wait times. Note that there is weak,
        positive correlation between ethnicity and median income
        (Pearson <em>r</em> = 0.27 for SF and <em>r</em> = 0.47 for
        NYC, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), therefore it is expected to
        see some mixed effects of these features.</p>

      <p>Urban transportation services serve a critically important
      role in our society, and a proper understanding of their
      dynamics is essential for a variety of tasks. Recently,
      ridesharing has begun to “disrupt” long-standing services
      such as taxis and public transportation. However, despite
      their popularity, we know relatively little about the service
      that incumbent ridesharing services provide, and how they
      interact with existing services and the city as a whole.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we present the first head-to-head
      comparison of Uber, Lyft, and taxis. We collect 40 days of
      data in SF and 27 days in NYC from Uber and Lyft's mobile
      applications, and obtained taxi data in the same time period
      from the SFCTA. From this data, we extracted four key market
      features from all three services: price, supply, demand, and
      wait time.</p>
      <p>Our results extend the existing VFH literature in key
      ways. First, we introduce a novel statistical method for
      validating measured ridesharing data. Second, we highlight
      key differences between Uber and Lyft's surge pricing
      algorithms (and update findings from prior
      work&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]), and show that a significant
      fraction of Lyft drivers are simultaneously driving for Uber
      as well. Third, we rigorously investigate the accessibility
      of VFH services across SF and NYC using spatial lag models.
      Overall, our results independently confirm key findings from
      the economics literature&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
