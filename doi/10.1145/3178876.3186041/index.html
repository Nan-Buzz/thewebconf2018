        <p><small>Dynamic mechanisms are a powerful technique in
        designing revenue-maximizing repeated auctions. Despite
        their strength, these types of mechanisms have not been
        widely adopted in practice for several reasons, e.g., for
        their complexity, and for their sensitivity to the accuracy
        of predicting buyers’ value distributions. In this paper,
        we aim to address these shortcomings and develop simple
        dynamic mechanisms that can be implemented efficiently, and
        provide theoretical guidelines for decreasing the
        sensitivity of dynamic mechanisms on prediction accuracy of
        buyers’ value distributions. We prove that the dynamic
        mechanism we propose is provably dynamic incentive
        compatible, and introduce a notion of buyers’ regret in
        dynamic mechanisms, and show that our mechanism achieves
        bounded regret while improving revenue and social welfare
        compared to a static reserve pricing policy. Finally, we
        confirm our theoretical analysis via an extensive empirical
        study of our dynamic auction on real data sets from online
        adverting. For example, we show our dynamic mechanisms can
        provide a <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$+17\%$</span></span> revenue lift with relative
        regret less than 0.2%.</small></p>

      <p>The majority of online advertising platforms run a
      sequence of repeated auctions to sell their inventory of
      page-views. While much of the existing literature for such ad
      auctions discuss static one-shot auctions, using dynamic
      auctions optimized across different time periods could
      potentially bring significant gains both in terms of revenue
      and social welfare. The power of dynamic mechanisms has been
      observed by a number of recent papers [<a class="bib"

      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>, <a class="bib"

      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>]. We refer to the survey
      by Bergemann and Said [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] for a comprehensive treatment on the
      subject.</p>
      <p>Even though dynamic mechanisms can be much more effective
      in maximizing revenue and social welfare, they have not been
      widely adopted in practice. The main issues therein are
      partially the shortcomings of dynamic mechanisms: One major
      issue is the complexity induced by the exponentially growing
      design space, making it difficult to solve or even to
      describe such mechanisms. Another issue is that the
      incentives under dynamic environments rely on the consistency
      between the seller and buyers on the impact of current
      actions on future outcomes, while such consistency requires a
      higher order common knowledge assumption that generally does
      not hold in practice. For example, the accuracy of the
      seller's prediction of the buyer's valuations plays a key
      role in the level of dynamic incentive compatibility ensured
      by the mechanism; the less accurate the seller's belief about
      buyer's valuation, the more incentive constraints are
      violated. This becomes more challenging in high-dimensional
      settings where learning buyers’ value distributions is very
      hard, and the estimates may be noisy.</p>
      <p>Recently, a series of work has made significant progress
      on the first issue of complexity described above. For
      example, Ashlagi et&nbsp;al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] and Mirrokni et&nbsp;al. [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>] show that
      an ϵ-approximate optimal dynamic mechanism can be efficiently
      computed via a dynamic program. However, such an approach
      relies on the forecast of the sequence of future items and
      then solves large linear programs recursively via backward
      induction. Mirrokni et&nbsp;al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] introduce the so-called <em>bank
      account mechanisms</em> that have simple structure and can
      achieve the optimal revenue with ex-ante individual
      rationality in single buyer cases. Later on, the authors
      extend the bank account framework to guarantee ex-post
      individual rationality and show a simple randomized
      construction that 5-approximates the optimal revenue for
      general multiple buyer cases [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>]. Balseiro et&nbsp;al. [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] consider a
      similar single buyer setting with i.i.d. values over the
      items across different periods and design simple and
      deterministic mechanisms that approach the optimal revenue in
      the limit.</p>
      <p>Despite all these improvements made on the complexity
      issue, the existing approaches above for multiple buyer cases
      still require randomized allocation rules<a class="fn" href=
      "#fn4" id="foot-fn4"><sup>1</sup></a> that are undesirable in
      real applications. More importantly, none of them has
      discussed the unavailability of the accurate prior knowledge
      on the distributions of buyer values in practice, yet all of
      them adopt the dynamic incentive notion that is sensitive to
      the prediction errors on the buyer values.</p>
      <p><em>Impacts of Learning on Incentives</em>. A central
      problem in the intersection of game theory and machine
      learning is how to learn optimal mechanism from data (see for
      example the papers by Morgenstern and Roughgarden [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>],
      ,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]). For
      static mechanism design (the case studied in previous
      papers), errors in estimating distributions can hurt revenue
      but don't hurt incentive constraints. In dynamic mechanism
      design, the estimation error also harms incentive
      compatibility. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
      paper to formally define and estimate a measure of the
      robustness of the mechanism with respect to learning errors
      (buyer regret). This is particularly important since dynamic
      mechanisms offer a promise of quite significant improvements
      in both revenue and allocation efficiency (both in theory and
      in data).</p>
      <p><em>Our Contribution</em>. Firstly, we propose a family of
      special bank account mechanisms, coined <em>Dynamic Second
      Price Auctions (DSP)</em>, for general multiple buyer
      settings, which addresses the practical issues raised in the
      previous paragraph. The auctions have a very common auction
      format (second price auctions with reserves) except that the
      reserves are adjusted dynamically depending on the history of
      the auction.<a class="fn" href="#fn5" id=
      "foot-fn5"><sup>2</sup></a> Our main goal in this paper is
      <em>not</em> to design the revenue optimal auction but
      instead to offer a pragmatic design of dynamic mechanisms
      that can be implemented in practice and is easy to switch
      from a second price auction with reserves, which is a default
      auction run by most advertising exchanges.</p>
      <p>We assume a baseline static second price auction with
      personalized reserves. We are agnostic to the nature of those
      reserves, they can be either the revenue optimal reserves or
      chosen with a different goal, e.g., to maximize a combination
      of revenue and welfare. Our main theorem shows how to process
      existing reserves and produce an auction that is dynamic
      incentive compatible (Theorem&nbsp;<a class="enc" href=
      "#enc2">3.1</a>) and strictly improves over the baseline
      auction both in terms of revenue and social welfare
      (Proposition&nbsp;<a class="enc" href="#enc3">3.2</a>).
      Moreover, we confirm on data that this improvement is quite
      significant (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-17">5</a>).</p>
      <p>The idea of the DSP is as follows: in static second price
      auctions, reserves improve revenue at the expense of
      efficiency. DSP first improves the efficiency by introducing
      dynamic discounts on the reserves based on how much utility
      the buyers accumulated in past periods. DSP then also
      introduces an extra payment (termed “bank account spent”)
      that gives the buyer the right to participate in the auction
      with lower reserves. Such payments will compensate for the
      loss in revenue by lowering reserves. The discount policy and
      the accompanying fees should be carefully calculated not to
      harm incentive compatibility and individual rationality.</p>
      <p>Secondly, we introduce the notion of <em>buyer regret</em>
      (or simply regret) to quantify how much the dynamic incentive
      compatibility is violated (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-14">4</a>). Intuitively, the regret of a buyer means
      how much the buyer can increase his/her utility by rejecting
      all the dynamic discounts. We import the <em>bank account
      limits</em> studied by Mirrokni et&nbsp;al. [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] to enable a trade-off
      between revenue lifts and buyer regrets: the regrets can be
      bounded by the product of bank account limits and prediction
      errors (Theorem&nbsp;<a class="enc" href="#enc5">4.2</a>).
      Such insights provide theoretical guidelines to reduce the
      regret.</p>
      <p>Finally, we conduct empirical studies to justify our
      insights on real data from online ad auctions
      (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-17">5</a>). To the
      best of our knowledge, this is the first work that examines
      the power of simple dynamic auctions on real data sets. In
      the first part, we simulate DSPs with different baseline
      reserves and dynamic discounts and show how the revenue
      lifts, regrets, and buyer utilities change as bank account
      limits increase. In particular, the revenue lift could be as
      much as <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$+150\%$</span></span> comparing to the second price
      auctions with monopoly reserves [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>] while incurring relative regret 13%
      (of the corresponding buyer utility), or <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$+17\%$</span></span>
      revenue lift with relative regret less than 0.2%. In the
      second part, we compare the statistics for the same auctions
      but with empirical distributions of different levels of
      accuracy (including simulations on synthetic data generated
      from known distributions, so we have access to the ground
      truth distributions in this case) and observe that the
      regrets decrease significantly while keeping the revenue
      lifts almost unchanged. Combining the observations from both
      parts, we conclude that the guidelines from
      Theorem&nbsp;<a class="enc" href="#enc5">4.2</a> do help in
      reducing the regrets.</p>

          Preliminaries</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>We study a setting where a seller repeatedly interacts
      with <em>n</em> buyers selling one item per period over
      <em>T</em> periods. The value of each agent <em>i</em> ∈
      [<em>n</em>] for the item in period <em>t</em> ∈ [<em>T</em>]
      is <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$v^i_t \in
      \mathcal {V}$</span></span> . If <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$x^i_t \in [0,
      1]$</span></span> represents the probability that agent
      <em>i</em> is allocated the item in period <em>t</em>, his
      utility is <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$v^i_t \cdot x^i_t$</span></span> .</p>
      <p>Throughout this paper, (i) we use superscripts as the
      indices of agents, bold fonts for vectors of all agents
      (i.e., <strong>a</strong> = (<em>a</em> <sup>1</sup>, …,
      <em>a<sup>n</sup></em> )), and superscript − <em>i</em> for
      the vector except the <em>i</em>-th element (i.e., <em>a</em>
      <sup>− <em>i</em></sup> = (<em>a</em> <sup>1</sup>, …,
      <em>a</em> <sup><em>i</em> − 1</sup>, <em>a</em>
      <sup><em>i</em> + 1</sup>, …, <em>a<sup>n</sup></em> )); (ii)
      we use subscripts as the indices of periods and <em>a</em>
      <sub>1..<em>t</em></sub> to denote the sequence <em>a</em>
      <sub>1</sub>, …, <em>a<sub>t</sub></em> .</p>
      <p>The values <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$v^i_t$</span></span> are assumed to be drawn from
      independent<a class="fn" href="#fn6" id=
      "foot-fn6"><sup>3</sup></a> distributions <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$F^i_t$</span></span> .
      The distributions <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$F^i_t$</span></span> are assumed to be common
      knowledge but the realizations of the random variables are
      initially unknown for both the agents and the designer. At
      each period, the following events happen:</p>
      <ol class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="(1)">each agent <em>i</em> learns his
        value <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$v^i_t \sim F^i_t$</span></span> ;<br /></li>
        <li id="list2" label="(2)">each agent <em>i</em> reports
        value <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\hat{v}^i_t$</span></span> to the
        designer;<br /></li>
        <li id="list3" label="(3)">the designer implements an
        outcome <em>x<sub>t</sub></em> ∈ [0, 1]
        <sup><em>n</em></sup> and charges the agents
        <em>p<sub>t</sub></em> ;<br /></li>
        <li id="list4" label="(4)">each agent accrues utility
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$u^i_t =
        v^i_t \cdot x^i_t - p^i_t$</span></span> .<br /></li>

      <p>A dynamic mechanism can then be described in terms of a
      pair of maps for each period, which associate the history of
      reports <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$\hat{v}_{1..t} = (\hat{v}_1, \hat{v}_2, \ldots ,

      i.e., <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$x_t:
      \mathcal {V}^{nt} \rightarrow [0, 1]^n$</span></span> and
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$p_t:
      \mathcal {V}^{nt} \rightarrow \mathbb {R}^n$</span></span> .
      Therefore we can define:</p>
      <div class="table-responsive">
        <div class="display-equation">
          <span class="tex mytex">\begin{align*} u^i_t(v^i_t;
          \hat{v}_{1..t}) = v^i_t \cdot x^i_t(\hat{v}_{1..t}) -
          p^i_t(\hat{v}_{1..t})\end{align*}</span><br />
        </div>
      </div>If <em>x<sub>t</sub></em> and <em>p<sub>t</sub></em>
      are only functions of the valuations <em>v<sub>t</sub></em>
      reported in time <em>t</em>, the mechanism is static.

        <p>A mechanism is incentive compatible if it provides
        incentives for agents to reveal their true types in each
        iteration. Such conditions for dynamic mechanisms can be
        easily defined by backward induction: in the last period,
        regardless of the history so far and other agents’ reports,
        it should be incentive compatible for each agent to report
        his true value. This corresponds to the usual notion of
        incentive compatibility in (static) mechanism design:</p>

        we will omit the “for-all” quantification and assume all
        expressions are quantified as “for-all” in its free
        variables. For the next-to-last-period, it should be
        incentive compatible for the agent given that he will
        report truthfully in the following period:

        <p>The space of mechanisms satisfying <a class="eqn" href=
        "#eq1">DIC</a> and <a class="eqn" href="#eq2">eP-IR</a> is
        very broad and unstructured. We restrict our attention in
        this section to a subclass of dynamic mechanisms introduced
        by Mirrokni et&nbsp;al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] called <em>bank account
        mechanisms</em>. The mechanisms are simple, dynamic
        incentive compatible by design and have the notable feature
        that for any distribution, there is a revenue-optimal bank
        account mechanisms. More precisely, for any dynamic
        mechanism satisfying <a class="eqn" href="#eq1">DIC</a> and
        <a class="eqn" href="#eq2">eP-IR</a> there is a bank
        account mechanism with at least the same welfare and
        revenue.</p>
        <p>Bank account mechanisms keep a state for each buyer,
        which is a scalar called <em>balance</em>. Each period
        depends on the previous periods through the vector of buyer
        balances. Another main feature is that in this framework,
        the designer needs to specify single-period auctions that
        are single-period incentive compatible together with a
        valid balance update policy. That is, once a valid balance
        update policy is in place, all the designer needs to worry
        about are single-period incentive compatibility
        constraints.</p>
        <p>A bank account mechanism <em>B</em> is defined in terms
        of the following functions for each period:</p>

        "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] show that the balance can be used
        as a measure of inter-period dependency. One extreme are
        mechanisms that always keep balance at zero for all buyers.
        Since bank account mechanisms can only depend on previous
        periods via balance, if balances are constant equal to zero
        the mechanism must run independent static auctions in each
        period.</p>
        <p>Based on this observation, the authors propose the
        design of bank account mechanisms with a limit as a way to
        limit inter-period dependencies. Formally, the limit
        <em>L<sup>i</sup></em> on the bank account of buyer
        <em>i</em> means that a bank account mechanism satisfies an

      <p>Mirrokni et&nbsp;al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>] propose simple auctions following
      the bank account framework that are provably near-optimal,
      but still rely on randomized allocations for the revenue
      guarantee. The auction formats in each period are also
      non-standard. In contrast, most auctions used in practice are
      variations over second price auctions with reserves.</p>
      <p>Our focus on this paper is to design a family of practical
      dynamic mechanisms that could be easily implemented in
      practice using the current infrastructure for running second
      price auctions with reserves. Our auction will be still based
      on the bank account framework and the twist with respect to
      usual second price auctions is that the reserves will be
      dynamic and adjusted based on reports from past periods.</p>
      <p>Before we describe our dynamic auction, we recall the two
      implementations of second price auctions with personalized
      reserve&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>]. Given reported values
      <em>v<sub>i</sub></em> for each agent and reserves
      <em>r<sub>i</sub></em> the following auctions are
      single-period incentive compatible:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list7" label="•"><em>Eager reserves:</em> The
        winner is the highest bidder such that
        <em>v<sub>i</sub></em> ≥ <em>r<sub>i</sub></em> and his
        payment is the maximum between his reserve and the bid of
        the second highest buyer above reserves. If no buyer is
        above his reserve, there is no winner.<br /></li>
        <li id="list8" label="•"><em>Lazy reserves:</em> We select
        the buyer with the highest bid. If his bid is above reserve
        he is the winner and his payment is the maximum of his
        reserve and the second highest bid (regardless of whether
        the second highest is below or above reserve). If the
        selected buyer is below his reserve, there is no
        winner.<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>They differ in the ordering of filtering and ranking. In
      the eager we first filter buyer below reserve and then rank
      them. In the lazy we first rank buyers based on their bid and
      then we filter the top buyer based on his reserve. The
      auction we propose is a hybrid where we have for each buyer a
      vector of eager reserves <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$r_t^E$</span></span> and
      a vector of lazy reserves <span class=

        <p>Our goal in this paper is to design practical dynamic
        mechanism that are competitive against simple static second
        price auctions with reserves. We are agnostic to how
        reserve prices are computed and we assume instead there is
        a baseline auction applying reserve price <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{r}^i_t$</span></span> in each iteration.
        Those could be the revenue-optimal reserves or could be
        reserves that are designed, for example, to optimize
        revenue subject to a constraint on the welfare loss. Our
        goal will be to process those reserves and come up with a
        dynamic auction that improves the original one in terms of
        both welfare and revenue.</p>
        <p>Our auction will take as input for each buyer <em>i</em>
        and step <em>t</em> a baseline reserve price <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{r}^i_t$</span></span> , distributions
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$F^i_t$</span></span> and bank account limts
        <em>L<sup>i</sup></em> . Based on <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{r}^i_t$</span></span> and <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$F^i_t$</span></span>
        we will have a pre-processing step that generates reserve
        lower bounds <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\underline{r}^i_t \le
        \overline{r}^i_t$</span></span> . In Section <a class="sec"
        href="#sec-13">3.2</a> we will discuss which properties are
        required from the pre-processing step. For now, we just
        assume the DSP auction has access to a range of dynamic
        reserves <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

        <p>We show that the DSP auction can always generate
        strictly higher revenue and social welfare than the second
        price auction with baseline reserves <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{r}_{1..T}$</span></span> , as long as (i)
        the dynamic lazy reserves <em>r<sub>t</sub></em> and
        <em>r</em> <sub><em>t</em></sub> are properly designed,
        (ii) the prior distributions <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$F^i_{1..T}$</span></span> have positive probability
        densities near the baseline reserves,<a class="fn" href=
        "#fn7" id="foot-fn7"><sup>4</sup></a> (iii) and the
        baseline reserves are neither obviously too high nor too
        low.</p>
        <p>The DSP auction is particularly effective with respect
        to static second price auctions when bank account balances
        <em>b<sub>t</sub></em> are sufficiently large such that the
        dynamic reserves could be set as <em>r<sub>t</sub></em> =
        <em>r</em> <sub><em>t</em></sub> without breaking the
        <a class="eqn" href="#eq5">BU</a> constraint. In this case,
        the allocation in each period is exactly the same as the
        second price auction with reserves being <em>r</em>
        <sub><em>t</em></sub> , hence higher social welfare than
        the baseline with larger reserves <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\overline{r}_t \ge
        \underline{r}_t$</span></span> . The improvement is strict
        if the allocation probability gets increased by the
        reduction of reserves, which can be easily achieved via
        properly chosen <em>r</em> <sub><em>t</em></sub> as long as
        the baseline reserves are not obviously too low, i.e., the
        social welfare has not been maximized by the baseline.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the revenue strictly increases because the
        expected buyer utilities decrease. For each buyer
        <em>i</em>, according to constraint <a class="eqn" href=
        "#eq4">BI</a>, his/her expected utility is a constant with
        respect to the balance <em>b</em> <sub><em>t</em> −
        1</sub>, in particular, the same as the expected utility
        when <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$b^i_{t-1} = 0$</span></span> . In this case, the
        auction is equivalent to the second price auction with
        reserves <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{r}^i_t$</span></span> for buyer <em>i</em>
        and <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\underline{r}^{-i}_t$</span></span> for others from
        his/her perspective, because the spent <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$s^i_t =
        0$</span></span> (<span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$s^i_t \le
        b^i_{t-1}$</span></span> ) and hence the dynamic reserve
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$r^i_t$</span></span> is set equal to <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{r}^i_t$</span></span> to satisfy
        constraint <a class="eqn" href="#eq4">BI</a>. Therefore,
        comparing with the baseline, the expected utility of buyer
        <em>i</em> is hurt by the reduction of the reserves of
        other buyers, independent of the spent <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$s^i_t$</span></span>
        .<a class="fn" href="#fn8" id=
        "foot-fn8"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
        <p>If the balances <em>b<sub>t</sub></em> are large, the
        algorithm will choose lazy reserves <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$r_t^i =
        \underline{r}_t^i$</span></span> and the social welfare
        will be an improvement over the social welfare of the
        baseline auction. If the balances <em>b<sub>t</sub></em>
        are too low, however, the lazy reserves <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$r_t^i$</span></span>
        could be closer to <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{r}_t^i$</span></span> and cause the social
        welfare to be even worse. Let <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathsf
        {sW}$</span></span> be the welfare of the static auction
        with reserves <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{r}_t^i$</span></span> and <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathsf
        {dW}({b}_t)$</span></span> the welfare of the dynamic
        auciton with balances <em>b<sub>t</sub></em> . Then we
        define:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <div class="display-equation">

            {dW}({b}) ]^+ \]</span><br />
          </div>
        </div>Now, if we can guarantee that the balance is high
        most of the time, then the welfare lift will be closer to

        arguments from stochastic processes, the balance is far
        from <em>L<sup>i</sup></em> with probability exponentially
        decreasing in <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

        In other words, the social welfare is guaranteed to be

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>In order to empirically justify the incentive guarantees
        of dynamic mechanisms, we introduce the notion of buyer
        <em>regret</em>, which measures the utility gain of a buyer
        by disabling his/her bank account (i.e., deposits
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$d^i_t
        \equiv 0$</span></span> ). For fixed actions of other
        buyers, the sequence of items, and the valuations of buyer
        <em>i</em>, the regret of buyer <em>i</em> refers to
        his/her utility change from the dynamic mechanism to a copy
        of this mechanism with <em>the dynamic components disabled
        for him/her only</em>. By disabling the dynamic components
        for a certain buyer, we mean his/her bank account is
        disabled, i.e., the balance is fixed to be zero. Hence
        his/her reserve price of the <em>t</em>-th item will be
        fixed at <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$r^i_t = \overline{r}^i_t$</span></span> ,
        independent of the past periods.</p>
        <p>One practical feature of this mechanism is that by
        disabling deposits for one buyer, i.e. <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$d_t^i =
        0$</span></span> , the buyer will face a static auction, in
        the sense that his/her bids in one iteration don't affect
        his allocation probability or pricing in subsequent rounds.
        This provides a smooth transition where buyers are allow to
        opt-in to participate in the dynamic mechanism or otherwise
        keep participating in a static auction. If we have perfect
        access to the distributions of buyers, it should be
        indifferent for the buyer's utility to opt-in to the
        dynamic component. However, if the priors are not perfectly
        calculated, it is possible for buyers to regret the
        decision to participate in a dynamic auction. In this
        section we formally define and bound the notion of buyer
        regret in a dynamic mechanism.</p>

          <p>For any fixed sequence of items and valuations, the
          regret of buyer <em>i</em> from a DSP <em>M</em> is
          defined as the difference of his/her utilities from

      <p>Finally, we use anonymized real bid data from a major ad
      exchange to evaluate the simple dynamic auction we proposed
      and establish the trade-offs between the regret and the
      revenue-lift via the limits on bank accounts.</p>
      <p><em>Data Sets</em>. The data set is a collection of
      auction records, where each record corresponds to a real time
      auction for an impression and consists of a seller
      (publisher) id and a set of bid records. Each bid record
      corresponds to a buyer id and the value of the bid submitted
      by that buyer to the auction. Our data set will consist of
      auctions with bids from 5 large buyers over the period of 2
      days. We will partition the data set into a <em>training
      set</em> consisting of data for the first day and a
      <em>testing set</em> consisting of data for the second
      day.</p>
      <p><em>Learning the Valuation Distributions</em>. Before
      running the simulation, we need to do some preprocessing of
      the data set to learn the valuation distributions of the
      buyers. In order to justify our insights about the impact of
      prediction errors on regrets from Section&nbsp;<a class="sec"
      href="#sec-14">4</a>, we learn several distribution
      estimators <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$\tilde{F}$</span></span> with different levels of
      accuracies. In Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-19">5.2</a>, we conduct same auctions with these
      estimators and compare the simulation results.</p>
      <p><em>Empirical Distributions</em>:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list19" label="•"><tt>NAIVE</tt>: one empirical
        distribution for the bids of each buyer;<br /></li>
        <li id="list20" label="•"><tt>PUBLISHER</tt>: one empirical
        distribution for the bids of each buyer-publisher
        pair.<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>We learn distributions based on real data from the first
      day and evaluate using real data form the second day. This
      provides an evaluation for our methods when we have a noisy
      estimation of distribution.</p>
      <p><em>Parameterized Distributions</em>:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list21" label="•"><tt>LOGNORMAL</tt>: for each
        buyer, we fit a lognormal distribution <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\ln \mathcal {N}(\mu ,
        \sigma ^2)$</span></span> , by maximum likelihood
        estimation.<br /></li>
      </ul>
      <p>For parametric distributions, we fit a log normal using
      real ad data from the first day and sample from those
      distributions to generate synthetic data for the second day.
      We do so to evaluate our methods in the case we have a
      perfect estimation of the distribution. Hence the only source
      of regret must be the random noises from generated data and
      the numerical errors of the simulation.</p>

            Evaluating the Performance</h3>

        </header>
        <p>For each DSP <em>M</em>, we evaluate its <em>revenue
        lift</em>, <em>welfare lift</em>, and <em>buyer utility
        losses</em> comparing with the second price auction with
        reserves being the baseline reserves of <em>M</em>, as well
        as the <em>relative buyer regrets</em> (buyer regret /
        buyer utility). All these statistics are plotted in planes
        (see Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>,
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>,
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>, and
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> grouped by
        each statistic and each baseline reserve) with x-axis being
        the bank account limit (in log-scale, <em>L</em> = 0
        excluded) and points with the same <em>α</em> are connected
        as different curves. Therefore, these curves show the
        trends of the statistics as the bank account limit
        increases.</p>

            Improvements on revenue and social welfare. Absolute

          </div>
        </figure>
        <p><em>Interpretation</em>. In all these figures, it can be
        easily observed that the DSPs tend to be farther from the
        static baseline as the bank account limit <em>L</em>
        becomes larger. In particular, when <em>L</em> is larger
        than certain thresholds (e.g., 5 for <tt>MINOPT</tt> and 1
        for <tt>ROBUST</tt>) the changes become flat. These DSPs
        are already close to the one with <em>L</em> = ∞.</p>
        <p>Moreover, as the bank account limit increases, both the
        revenue and social welfare increase while the buyer utility
        decreases, consistent with our insights in
        Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-13">3.2</a>. In
        particular, as we expect in Proposition&nbsp;<a class="enc"
        href="#enc3">3.2</a>, for all different <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{r}$</span></span> , both the improvements
        on revenue and social welfare are strictly positive and
        significant for sufficiently large <em>L</em> (&gt; 0.2).
        Concretely, (see Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
        "#tab1">1</a>) these improvements can be roughly as large
        as <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$+150\%$</span></span> for revenue and <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$+41.9\%$</span></span>
        for welfare when <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{r}$ $=$<tt>MINOPT</tt></span></span>
        (<span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$+91.5\%$</span></span> and <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$+19.7\%$</span></span>
        for <tt>CAPPED</tt>, <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$+62.8\%$</span></span>
        and <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$+11.6\%$</span></span> for <tt>ROBUST</tt>).
        Surprisingly, significant improvements (<span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$+17.2\%$</span></span>
        revenue and <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$+5.04\%$</span></span> welfare) can be achieved even
        with little buyer utility loss <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$-1.01\%$</span></span>
        and relative regret 0.19%.</p>
        <p>In addition, as <em>L</em> becomes small, the regrets
        get reduced as suggested by the guidelines from
        Theorem&nbsp;<a class="enc" href="#enc5">4.2</a>.</p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">5.2</span> Part II:
            Understanding the Regrets</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>For each estimator <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\tilde{F}$</span></span> , we draw two graphs, each
        of them containing all the DSPs using <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\tilde{F}$</span></span> as their estimator. In
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a>, the first
        row of graphs shows the trade-offs between revenue lifts
        (x-axis) and relative buyer regrets (y-axis); the second
        row of graphs shows the improvements on revenue (x-axis)
        and social welfare (y-axis).</p>
        <p><em>Interpretation</em>. In each of the subgraphs of
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a>, almost
        linear trade-offs between revenue lifts and relative
        regrets can be observed, where the slopes (for estimators
        <tt>NAIVE</tt> and <tt>PUBLISHER</tt>) are roughly 0.03 to
        0.08. In particular, the better trade-offs (flatter slopes)
        can be achieved by either choosing less aggressive
        baselines (<tt>ROBUST</tt> ≺ <tt>CAPPED</tt> ≺
        <tt>MINOPT</tt>) or using more accurate estimators
        (<tt>LOGNORMAL</tt> ≻ <tt>PUBLISHER</tt> ≻ <tt>NAIVE</tt>),
        in the same spirit of Theorem&nbsp;<a class="enc" href=
        "#enc5">4.2</a>.</p>
        <p>Similarly, as shown in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig5">5</a>, the revenues and social welfares from
        different DSPs are quasi-linearly related. The more
        accurate estimator being used, the closer the slopes of the
        trends are to 1 (cf. the 45° line), which means the less
        revenue comes from buyer utility losses.</p>
        <p>Finally, attentive readers may notice that the numbers
        for estimator <tt>LOGNORMAL</tt> are quite different from
        the corresponding ones for the other two estimators, like
        the revenue lifts or the revenue versus social welfare in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a>. Such
        “unexpected” differences in fact come from the differences
        between the revenue and social welfare of the baseline
        auctions (second price auctions with reserves) from
        different simulations, caused by the stochastic differences
        between the real bids from the test set and the synthetic
        bids generated by the lognormal distribution learned from
        the training set. As we mentioned previously, the training
        set and test set consist of bids from the first and the
        second day. The phenomenon we just observed reflects one
        fundamental difficulty in minimizing the prediction errors,
        that is, the distribution of buyer values is probably
        evolving over time. Therefore, the methodology of reducing
        the regret in the presence of prediction errors is
        necessary in applying dynamic mechanisms, because the
        prediction errors might be inevitable.</p>
