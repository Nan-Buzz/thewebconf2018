          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>One of the most investigated work in the domain of
      networks is the analysis of community structures [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. A lot of
      interesting and seminal approaches have been proposed, which
      are based on the topology of the networks. For example, in
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] authors
      presented a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm, based on
      link structure. In addition, various improvements have been
      proposed especially for scalability [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>]. The basic idea behind
      all these approaches is that in a network, the nodes which
      are more densely connected with each other are part of a
      community compared to rest of the nodes. For more intensive
      surveys regarding the topological based community detection
      approaches, readers can refer to [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>], [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>], and [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>].</p>
      <p>The topology based algorithms only consider the structure
      of the network and ignores the attributes of the nodes while
      identifying communities. Examples of attributes include
      geographic location, interests, affiliations, etc. These
      attributes<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> can be a reason to motivate users
      to align with a particular set of nodes in a network, and
      form communities. For example, consider the famous Zachary
      club dataset, which is often the test bed for various
      community detection algorithms (Figure 2(a), [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]). The two main communities
      were formed because of the opinion of the club members
      regarding the fee structure with respect to the views of the
      president and the instructor. Thus, if opinion can be
      considered as an example of attribute, then based on the
      above example, one can argue that attribute (in this case the
      opinion) plays an important role in community formation.
      However, that may not be the case for each community
      formation.</p>
      <p>Recently, there has been interest among the researchers in
      the domain of attribute based communities. In this line of
      research, works include proposal of i) detecting communities
      by using the attribute information of the nodes [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] as well as
      analysing community structures solely based on attributes
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>], or ii)
      hybrid approach, which exploits both topology of networks and
      the attributes of the nodes [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] and [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>].</p>
      <p>In a different set of works, which are closer to that of
      ours, researchers have evaluated various community detection
      algorithms by using a priori information about the
      communities in the networks [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]. The objective of this work is
      different, as we investigate nodes’ similarity in the
      communities, which are identified through topology based
      community detection algorithms.</p>
      <p>Let <em>G</em> &lt; <em>N</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>I</em>
      &gt; represents a network, where <em>N</em> represents the
      total nodes, <em>E</em> the total edges, and <em>I</em> as
      the total set of interests of all the nodes in the network
      <em>G</em>. Assuming <em>C</em> represents the set of
      communities formed from a network <em>G</em>, by using a
      topological based community detection algorithm. Let
      <em>C<sub>i</sub></em> &lt; <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$N_i^{\prime
      },E_i^{\prime },I_i^{\prime }$</span></span> &gt; ∈
      <em>C</em>, (where <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$N^{^{\prime }}$</span></span> ⊆ <em>N</em>,
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$E^{^{\prime
      }}$</span></span> ⊆ <em>E</em> and <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$I^{^{\prime
      }}$</span></span> ⊆ <em>I</em>), represents a community
      identified through some topological based community detection
      algorithms.</p>
      <p>To understand the similarity among the nodes, we have used
      four different types of similarity metrics which cover
      different perspectives of similarities (see Section III). Let
      <em>S</em> represents the similarity metric set. We calculate
      the similarity score among the neighboring nodes ∈
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$N^{^{\prime
      }}$</span></span> using each <em>S<sub>j</sub></em> ∈
      <em>S</em>, to understand how much attribute similarity is
      present among the nodes of a particular community.</p>
      <p>To the best of our knowledge, no work in the past has
      investigated attribute similarity of the nodes within the
      topological based communities. We study this problem by
      exploring three different real social network datasets,
      namely i) Blippr (product rating social network), ii) Last.fm
      (music based social network) and iii) Delicious (social
      bookmarking website). These three datasets have social
      network as well as have attribute information of the nodes in
      them. In contrast to the past studies [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>], [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>] based on the common
      belief that <em>birds of the same feather flocks
      together</em>, we found out that there exists a very low
      attribute similarity among the nodes of a community.</p>
      <p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Next, we
      describe the datasets. Section III presents our results
      related to community analysis. We conclude with a discussion
      of future directions in Section IV.</p>

      also link with other users as friends. For this dataset, we
      constitute five main categories, namely i) Movies/TV, ii)
      Technology (softwares, gadgets, etc.), iii) Music Album, iv)
      Video Games, and v) Books.
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Last.fm:</strong> This dataset has been collected
      from Last.fm<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
      "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>, which is a social network
      platform which allows tagging facility for the users, with
      respect to the artists. Users can also become friends with
      other users. In this dataset, the artists to which users
      listen is considered as attributes.</p>
      <p><strong>Delicious:</strong> Delicious<a class="fn" href=

      platform, where users can tag their favorite links along with
      creating social links with other users. In this dataset, the
      attribute is considered as the web links. Delicious and the
      Last.fm dataset was released by researchers at [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>].</p>
      <p>These particular datasets have been selected as the social
      network and attribute information of the nodes have not
      necessarily influenced each other unlike in DBLP
      co-authorship, where edge formation gets created due to a
      common interest (for example, publications in the similar
      domain).</p>
      <p>Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> enlists various
      network properties of the three datasets. All the three
      datasets have ∼ 2000 nodes. However, the total edges in these
      three datasets vary a lot. In spite of Last.fm having more
      edges than Delicious, the clustering coefficient of Delicious
      is higher. Also, the diameter (and average path length) of
      Delicious is much larger than that of Last.fm and Blippr. In
      the last row, we also provide information about the total
      number of interests for each network. All the three datasets
      show heavy-tailed degree distribution (Figures not shown due
      to space limitation).</p>

      nodes in a community. We conclude this section, with the
      discussion about the results.</p>

            Detection Algorithms</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The five community detection algorithms to generate
        communities are following:</p>
        <p><strong>1. Louvain:</strong> Based on the greedy
        modularity approach, the algorithm tries to optimize the
        modularity in a two step process. In the first step, small
        communities are identified and in the second step it
        collects nodes belonging to the same community and create
        new networks from the nodes denoting the communities. It is
        one of the fastest community detection algorithms and can
        handle very large networks. However, it often fails to
        produce communities of medium size [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>].</p>
        <p><strong>2. Infomap:</strong> The method is flow-based
        which exploits the maps of random walks [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>]. The approach uses the
        probability flow of random walks as a medium to extract
        communities by squeezing the path of walks to represent
        communities. The algorithm is also able to handle weighted
        and directed networks.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Demon:</strong> This algorithm uses a
        recursive approach to collect denser areas from
        ego-networks. Thus, the communities produce by this
        algorithm have higher internal density. As the method uses
        ego-networks as the starting point for community
        identification, the resultant communities can be
        overlapping in nature [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>].</p>
        <p><strong>4. Leading Eigenvector:</strong> The crux of the
        algorithm is the modularity matrix of the form A-P, where A
        is the adjacency matrix of the network and P represents the
        probability matrix for the edges between all the nodes of
        the network, considering it as a random network. The
        algorithm starts by calculating the eigenvector of the
        modularity matrix for the largest positive eigenvalue and
        then separating vertices into two communities based on the
        sign of the corresponding element in the eigenvector
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>].</p>
        <p><strong>5. Label Propagation:</strong> Initially, this
        algorithm assigns every node with a different label. At
        each iterative step, a node picks a most popular label
        among the labels of neighbors. Eventually, the nodes agrees
        on a label and form a part of a community. This iterative
        and simple strategy helps the algorithm in achieving a
        complexity which is linear in terms of execution time
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>].</p>
        <p>The above five community detection algorithms are
        diverse in nature as they follow different strategies to
        detect communities. For example, Demon produces overlapping
        communities, whereas other three generate disjoint
        communities. Louvain, Leading eigenvector, Infomap
        algorithms are much faster compared to Label propagation
        and Demon. Algorithms such as Label propagation are based
        on a bottom up approach, whereas Louvain uses a top-down
        methodology to detect communities.</p>
        <p>Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a> provides
        information about the number of communities generated
        through each of the community detection algorithms for each
        of the datasets. For Delicious and Last.fm, all the
        community detection algorithms have generated almost same
        number of communities. In Figure <a class="fig" href=
        "#fig1">1</a>, for each dataset and for each of the
        community detection algorithms, we provide detailed
        information about the number of communities with a
        particular size. In all the cases, the resultant number of
        communities shows heavy tail distribution. For our
        analysis, we have only considered the communities which are
        bigger than of size two.</p>

            Measurements</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>We now describe the similarity metrics which we used to
        analyse the similarity among the nodes of a community.
        These following metrics cover different aspects of
        similarity and cannot be considered as a replacement for
        one another.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Sim:</strong> We call our basic similarity
        measurement as <em>Sim</em>. For any two nodes
        <em>n<sub>x</sub></em> and <em>n<sub>y</sub></em> ,
        Sim(<span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$I_{n_x},I_{n_y}$</span></span> ) returns 1 if at
        least one common interest is present among any two
        neighboring nodes. That is if |<em>I<sub>x</sub></em> ∩
        <em>I<sub>y</sub></em> | ≥ 1, Sim(<span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$I_{n_x},I_{n_y}$</span></span> ) returns 1 otherwise
        0.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Jaccard:</strong> <em>Sim</em> has binary
        output. To cover the relative aspect of similarity, we
        measure the Jaccard similarity between every two connected
        nodes within communities. Formally, it is defined as ratio
        of |<em>I<sub>x</sub></em> ∩<em>I<sub>y</sub></em> | and
        |<em>I<sub>x</sub></em> ∪<em>I<sub>y</sub></em> |.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Cosine:</strong> Jaccard is a cardinality
        based measurement. To cover the degrees of similarity
        between two connected nodes, we measure the cosine
        similarity between the nodes, which is defined as the ratio
        of the dot product of the interest vectors
        (<em>I<sub>x</sub></em> . <em>I<sub>y</sub></em> ) and
        magnitude (||<em>I<sub>x</sub></em> ||
        ||<em>I<sub>y</sub></em> ||).</p>
        <p><strong>4. EI Index:</strong> Compared to the above
        three measurements which are edge based, we also measure a
        similarity metric based on the ego network of the nodes,
        which is based on the External-Internal (EI) Index
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. In the
        original definition, within a community, an edge with
        respect to a node is called internal if the other node
        connected with the edge is also within the same community
        otherwise it is called external. The modified definition in
        our analysis is as follows. For any community, the meaning
        of external and internal has to do with the interest and we
        only consider the edges of an ego network of the nodes
        which are present in the community under investigation. In
        other words, within a community, an edge for a node is
        considered internal if the other node has at least one
        common interest with respect to the ego node otherwise
        external. Unlike in the original EI index, the EI index is
        measured as the ratio of the difference between the total
        internal edges and total external edges to the union of
        external and internal edges. This is done for normalization
        purpose. In the above three metrics, the value of the
        similarity function lies between 0 and 1, where higher is
        the value the more similar two nodes are. In EI the value
        lies between -1 (no similarity) to +1 (equal). To present
        the results of all the metrics in the same graph we
        normalize the values of EI metric between 0 to 1.</p>

          <p><em>3.3.1 Similarity measures.</em> For each community
          obtained through various community detection algorithms,
          we measure the similarity values for each of the
          similarity metric (Sim, Jaccard, Cosine and EI) in each
          dataset. Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>, shows
          the results of similarity values in the reverse
          cumulative frequency distribution. The X-axis represents
          the similarity values from 0 to 1 and Y-axis the % of
          communities. For each of the datasets and for each
          similarity metric, we plot the outcome of various
          community detection algorithms that is Demon (ID),
          Multilevel (ML), Leading Eigenvector (LE), Label
          Propagation (LA), Infomap (IM). As each of the algorithms
          produces a different number (and size) of communities,
          thus, we first normalize different similarity outcomes
          from various different community detection algorithms
          before plotting the values in the same graph.</p>
          <p>As mentioned each graph shows the reverse cumulative
          distribution of the output. For example, in Figure
          <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>(a), 30% of the
          communities have similarity value of 1. In case of Demon,
          100 % of the communities have similarity value of at
          least 0.85. Thus, in general, if one expects that nodes
          within communities also have similar attributes, then the
          graphs should be more on the top right part of the box.
          That is more % of communities (top part of Y-axis) should
          have a high value of similarity (right part of the
          X-axis). The best similarity value is observed in the
          case of Blippr and Last.fm in case of <em>Sim</em>
          metric. Among the three datasets, Delicious shows the
          worst results for the similarity metrics. Among all the
          metrics, Cosine and Jaccard show the worst values for the
          similarities.</p>
          <p>The low similarity among the nodes’ attributes in a
          social network could be due to various reasons. Sometimes
          individuals become friends on online social platforms
          such as Facebook because of a meeting at a social
          gathering. In another real-life example, generally we are
          friends with our neighbors, however, that does not mean
          we have common interests. Thus, it is not important that
          structure-based communities also exhibit strong nodes
          similarity in terms of attributes.</p>

          <p><em>3.3.2 Entropy.</em> Within a community to measure
          the difference among the similarity output, we also
          calculate the entropy for all the four metrics using
          following standard formulation:</p>
          <div class="table-responsive" id="eq1">
            <div class="display-equation">
              <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} H(x) = -

              <span class="equation-number">(1)</span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p></p>
          <p>Where H(x) represents the final outcome of entropy,
          which is calculated by summing up the individual
          similarity value for each pair of nodes and among all the
          communities (j=1 to C), using a similarity function,
          represented by S. Lower values of the entropy mean there
          is not much difference among the values of similarities
          within a community. Figure <a class="fig" href=
          "#fig3">3</a> shows the output for all the three
          datasets. For each community formed using various
          community detection algorithms, that is, Demon (ID),
          Multilevel (ML), Leading Eigenvector (LE), Label
          Propagation (LA), Infomap (IM), we aggregate all the
          similarity values that is Sim (Sim), Jaccard (Jac),
          Cosine (Cos) and EI.</p>
          <p>We normalized the values of similarity between 0 to 1
          for all the similarity metrics. For simplicity, we
          categorise the entropy outcomes in five categories namely
          i) Min (representing 0 &lt; = H(x) &lt; 0.2 for Sim and 0
          &lt; = H(x) &lt; 1 for others), ii) below average
          (representing 0.2 &lt; = H(x) &lt; 0.4 for Sim and 1 &lt;
          = H(x) &lt; 2 for others), iii) average (representing 0.4
          &lt; = H(x) &lt; 0.6 for Sim and 2 &lt; = H(x) &lt; 3 for
          others), iv) above average (representing 0.6 &lt; = H(x)
          &lt; 0.8 for Sim and 3 &lt; = H(x) &lt; 4 for others),
          and v) max (representing 0.8 &lt; = H(x) &lt; = 1 for Sim
          and 4 &lt; = H(x) for others).</p>
          <p>A high entropy value means the similarity values
          within a community varies a lot among various neighboring
          nodes compared when the entropy is low. In Blippr (Figure
          <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>(a)), except in case of
          Cosine (c) and EI (EI) metric for communities detected by
          Demon (D) algorithm, in all other combinations, at least
          60 % of communities have less than or equal to average
          entropy. Among all the three datasets, Last.fm shows
          worst results as very few communities have a low range of
          entropies. Delicious shows the lowest entropy, with most
          of the communities, are less than <em>Average</em>
          category. Low entropy for Delicious also means that low
          similarity metrics (see sub Figures (c), (i), (f), (l) in
          Figure 3) is consistently present among various
          communities. In other words, most of the nodes in the
          Delicious communities are not similar in terms of their
          corresponding interests.</p>

          <p><em>3.3.3 Does size matters?.</em> We also analysed if
          the size of communities has any impact on the similarity
          output. The hypothesis behind this analysis is due to the
          fact that in small communities, people tend to have
          similar interests and in bigger communities, there is a
          high probability of varying interests being present among
          the nodes of a community.</p>
          <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> shows the
          outcome of our analysis. For each dataset and for each
          community, we plot the values between Community Size
          (X-axis) and similarity values (Y-axis) for each of the
          metrics, that is Sim, Cosine (Cos), Jaccard (Jac), EI.
          One common observation from all the figures is that
          <em>Sim</em> and EI show more similar behavior and on the
          other side, Jaccard and Cosine return similar similarity
          values. In case of Last.fm and Blippr, larger communities
          have always shown better values for Sim and EI metrics.
          However, this is not observed in the case of the
          Delicious dataset.</p>
          <p>For each community, we also measured the correlation
          between the size of the community and the similarity
          metric. Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab3">3</a> presents
          the results. <em>Sim</em> and EI again shows the
          direction similarity for all the datasets (except in the
          case of label propagation algorithm for the Delicious
          dataset). Only 10% of the values are 70 % or more
          correlated which is not a significant result. Thus, there
          is no clear correlation that exists between the community
          size and the similarity metric.</p>

      <p>In this paper, we investigated if the nodes in the
      communities derived from topological based community
      detection algorithms also exhibit interest similarity. We
      performed our analysis using three real social network
      datasets and five topological based community detection
      algorithm. In contrast to the general belief that <em>bird of
      the same feather flock together</em>, our results portray a
      different picture. We found out that on an average among all
      the communities, around 50 % of the nodes have similar
      interests.</p>
      <p>We plan to extend this work by analysing larger social
      network datasets to confirm our understanding. We would also
      like to incorporate more 1) metrics of similarities and 2)
      community detection algorithms in our analysis. We also would
      like to give a more statistical treatment to our analysis for
      our future work.</p>
