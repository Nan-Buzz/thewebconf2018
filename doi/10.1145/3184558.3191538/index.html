          Introduction</h2>

      </header>
      <p>Clinical trials play an important role in the evaluation
      of new medications and treatments. After designing the study,
      the first main task is to find patients that are eligible for
      a given study, i.e., that satisfy all <em>inclusion
      criteria</em> and do not satisfy any <em>exclusion
      criteria</em>. Unfortunately, in practice it is often a
      resource-intensive task to recruit enough patients to get
      statistically meaningful results. However, the increased
      usage of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in hospitals offers
      a promising opportunity to improve the recruitment process by
      automating parts of it.</p>
      <p>Even though data are recorded more and more in
      semi-structured ways, most of them are not sufficiently
      structured to be processed directly using a logic-based
      formalism. This means that all the complications of natural
      language processing (NLP) apply when the computer is supposed
      to find semantically matching patients.</p>
      <p>Apart from the NLP nature of the task, many other
      challenges need to be overcome to automate patient selection.
      As already emphasized in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>], a major challenge lies in the the
      fact that criteria are described on different levels of
      granularity, which range from quite specific to very general.
      This can often be bridged by using medical background
      knowledge that links broad categories (<em>“lung
      cancer”</em>) to more specific ones
      (<em>“adenocarcinoma”</em>) or even to more detailed
      descriptions (<em>“malignant neoplasm was found in the left
      lower lobe”</em>). Fortunately, a large amount of medical
      knowledge is nowadays readily available in a
      machine-processable form in medical ontologies such as
      SNOMED&nbsp;CT,<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> which is easily convertible into
      a Description Logic representation.</p>
      <p>There exist many different approaches to the problem of
      automatic patient matching. Most are based on classic
      information retrieval techniques&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>], while others are
      logic-based [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>]. In this
      paper we consider the problems encountered when designing an
      ontology-based query formalism that automatically maps
      eligible patients to clinical trials. We put a special
      emphasis on analyzing which are the conditions that the query
      formalism must be able to express. For the moment, we mostly
      ignore the problems caused by the fact that natural language
      descriptions of eligibility criteria need to be translated
      automatically into our formalism. This will, however, be an
      important topic for future research.</p>

      </header>
      <p>Our observations are based on real world datasets which we
      will briefly introduce in the following. The data consist of
      three main parts: the patient data containing the EHRs, the
      clinical trials, and the medical ontologies that can provide
      the necessary background knowledge to the computer.</p>

            Data</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Our observations about patient data are based on the
        real-world MIMIC-III<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id=
        "foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> dataset. It is a de-identified
        dataset of hospital admissions collected in two different
        hospitals in the US. In total it includes data associated
        with over 40.000 patients who stayed in intensive care
        units (ICUs). Each admission is associated with a number of
        diagnoses and procedures specified in the ICD-9 coding
        system.<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id=
        "foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> Additionally, reports, care
        notes, and discharge summaries collected during the
        admission are available in unstructured text form. In
        contrast to the diagnosis codes, each note has an exact
        time stamp, which allows more fine granular insights into
        the order of events occurring during a patient's stay in
        the hospital.</p>
        <p>Since MIMIC-III contains EHRs of patients that stayed in
        ICUs, the patients mostly suffer from severe diseases like
        cancer, or need an acute surgery or treatment, e.g., due to
        a stroke or a serious accident. Because of this it is much
        easier to find information about, e.g., cancer patients in
        MIMIC-III, than it is to find information about a patient
        with e.g., chronic lower back pain.</p>

        <p>A clinical trial specifies a collection of eligibility
        criteria, each of which is either an <em>inclusion
        criterion</em>, which needs to be satisfied by an eligible
        patient, or an <em>exclusion criterion</em>, which must not
        be satisfied by the patient. More than 250.000
        specifications of real-world trials can be found at
        ClinicalTrials.gov.<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id=
        "foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> Criteria are given in text form

            Ontologies</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The classification systems offered by medical ontologies
        have a great potential to bridge the gap between broad
        selection criteria and very fine granular patient data
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>]. In
        recent years, numerous medical ontologies have been
        constructed and enjoy a growth in popularity. The modeling
        paradigms range from relatively high-level hierarchical
        codings like ICD-9 to very detailed formal ontologies
        modeled in Description Logics, like SNOMED&nbsp;CT. Mapping
        concepts from one system to another can be problematic, but
        is facilitated by the UMLS Metathesaurus,<a class="fn"
        href="#fn7" id="foot-fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> which provides
        mappings between equivalent concepts in different
        ontologies.</p>
        <p>We will present our examples mainly from the point of
        view of ICD-9 and SNOMED&nbsp;CT, the latter of which can
        be formulated in the Description Logic <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathcal {E}\mathcal
        {L}$</span></span> . We translate all ICD-9 codes from the
        patient database into SNOMED&nbsp;CT, which allows a more
        fine-grained classification of diagnoses. Since
        SNOMED&nbsp;CT and ICD-9 have been developed for different
        purposes, it is often not possible to find an exact match
        for each code and concept. For example the ICD-9 code 174.9
        <em>“Malignant neoplasm of breast (female),
        unspecified”</em> is mapped to 41 possible concepts in
        SNOMED&nbsp;CT.</p>
        <p>Originally, most ontologies were designed to provide a
        reference for doctors and other domain experts about the
        relations of symptoms and diseases. Modeling patient data
        in such ontologies can be problematic, since they provide
        only limited support to representing a patient's history.
        Especially the support for temporal sequences, which play
        an important role when modeling patient records [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>], is not

        <p>Previous work&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=

        "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>] has proposed custom ontologies
        that define temporal concepts, which can be used to model
        clinical narratives. Unfortunately, this approach is not
        easily amenable to <em>reasoning</em> over these temporal
        representations, i.e., checking whether a patient's history
        actually matches a temporal criterion. In this paper, we
        base our approach on temporal ontology and query languages
        that include a dedicated temporal semantics&nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. Since
        existing medical ontologies are non-temporal and should
        ideally be used without modifications, we in particular
        focus on temporal <em>query</em> languages to express
        inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our query language is
        similar to the one proposed in&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>], but we extend it in
        several ways to accommodate the needs of clinical trial
        criteria.</p>
        <p>The Description Logic&nbsp;<span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathcal {E}\mathcal
        {L}$</span></span> &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=

        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] is a popular formalism for
        reasoning over medical ontologies, such as SNOMED&nbsp;CT,
        the Gene Ontology,<a class="fn" href="#fn8" id=
        "foot-fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> and the NCI Thesaurus.<a class=
        "fn" href="#fn9" id="foot-fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> It is based
        on the notions of <em>concepts</em> (<em>“cancer”</em> or
        <em>“liver”</em>) and <em>roles</em> (<em>“found in”</em>),
        which express relations between concepts (<em>“liver
        cancer”</em> is <em>“found in”</em> the <em>“liver”</em>)
        as well as concrete patient data (patient&nbsp;<em>143</em>
        is <em>“diagnosed with”</em> the disease <em>“liver
        cancer”</em><a class="fn" href="#fn10" id=

        that can be stated over patient data and <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathcal {E}\mathcal
        {L}$</span></span> ontologies, we consider <em>conjunctive

        </div>asks for all patients&nbsp;<em>x</em> that are
        diagnosed with a disease&nbsp;<em>y</em> that is classified
        as a cancer. Note that <em>“diagnosed with”</em> is not a
        relation from SNOMED&nbsp;CT, but a relation that is
        available in the patient database. The
        variable&nbsp;<em>y</em> is existentially quantified since
        we are not interested in the precise cancer diagnosis for
        each patient, but only need to ensure that there
        <em>exists</em> such a diagnosis. In the presence of the
        background knowledge (e.g., from SNOMED&nbsp;CT) that
        <em>“liver cancer”</em> is a subconcept of

      Throughout this section, we use CQs, and later temporal
      CQs&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>],
      as query language. For each example, we discuss how this
      query language needs to be extended in order to handle
      patient data and eligibility criteria.</p>
      <p>In many cases, the exact set of patients that match the
      trial criteria can only be approximated, and the final
      decision needs to be taken by the doctor in charge. Since the
      goal is to reduce the workload as much as possible, the list
      of candidates returned by our querying approach should not
      contain too many false positives. It is even more important,
      however, to eliminate the presence of false negatives, i.e.,
      not to discard any eligible patients; otherwise, the system
      would be nearly worthless for the doctors since in the end
      they still have to look at all patient records themselves.
      When designing the queries, we should thus determine whether
      they over- or under-approximate the actual set of eligible
      patients. <em>Under-approximating</em> the answers to an
      <em>inclusion criterion</em> may generate false negatives,
      and the same can happen when <em>over-approximating</em> the
      answers to an <em>exclusion criterion</em>.</p>

            Ambiguity</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Apart from ambiguity in natural language, which is
        exacerbated by the extensive use of abbreviations in
        clinical texts (for example, <em>“TBI”</em> could mean
        either <em>“total body irradiation”</em> or <em>“traumatic
        brain injury”</em>), ambiguity also appears in the
        structured data. For example, patient&nbsp;6470 from the
        MIMIC-III database has two recorded admissions; the first
        admission lists the ICD-9 diagnosis code 250.61
        <em>“Diabetes with neurological manifestations, type I, not
        stated as uncontrolled”</em>, while in the second admission
        another doctor used 250.01 <em>“Diabetes mellitus without
        mention of complications, type I, not stated as
        uncontrolled”</em>. This may have been intended, i.e., the
        <em>“neurological manifestations”</em> disappeared in the
        meantime, or they were simply not relevant for the second
        admission.</p>
        <p>Now imagine that we are searching for patients that are
        diagnosed with the SNOMED&nbsp;CT concept <em>“Diabetes
        mellitus type 1”</em>, using the CQ</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="eq2">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} \exists y.
            \text{diagnosed\_with}(x,y) \wedge
            \text{Diabetes\_mellitus\_type\_1}(y)
            \end{equation}</span><br />
            <span class="equation-number">(2)</span>
          </div>
        </div>This query would only find the second admission,
        leading to an underestimation of the duration of the
        diabetes in the example patient. The reason is that, while
        the ICD-9 code 250.01 is correctly matched by the UMLS
        Metathesaurus to subconcepts of <em>“Diabetes mellitus
        type&nbsp;1”</em> in SNOMED&nbsp;CT, this is not the case
        for 250.61. Rather, 250.61 is matched to <em>“Neurological
        disorder associated with type I diabetes mellitus
        (disorder)”</em>, which is defined as a <em>“Neurological
        disorder”</em> that is <em>“associated with” “Diabetes
        mellitus type&nbsp;1”</em> (where <em>“associated
        with”</em> is a role in SNOMED&nbsp;CT). Reasoning over
        SNOMED&nbsp;CT does not allow us to draw the conclusion
        that the patient had <em>“Diabetes mellitus
        type&nbsp;1”</em> at the time of the first admission.
        <p></p>
        <p>One possibility to resolve this is to add an ontological
        axiom to SNOMED&nbsp;CT to state that every patient
        <em>“diagnosed with”</em> a disease that is <em>“associated
        with”</em> a second disease is automatically <em>“diagnosed
        with”</em> the second disease as well. However, it is not
        clear how to practically answer CQs in the presence of such
        axioms, although theoretically optimal algorithms are
        known&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>]. Another way would be to
        under-approximate the effect of this axiom by supplementing
        the query&nbsp;(<a class="eqn" href="#eq2">2</a>) with the
        additional CQ</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="eq3">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{align} \exists y,z.

            <span class="equation-number">(3)</span>
          </div>
        </div>and taking the union of the results. This is a sound
        and nearly complete approximation of the proposed axiom,
        because SNOMED&nbsp;CT contains only chains of
        <em>“associated with”</em> relations of length at
        most&nbsp;2. That is, by adding one more intermediate
        variable to this query, we can actually capture
        <em>all</em> associated diseases that may occur in
        SNOMED&nbsp;CT.

        <p>To obtain the candidates for a single clinical trial, we
        need to query the database for all patients that satisfy
        all inclusion criteria, while <em>not</em> satisfying any
        exclusion criteria of that trial. Formally, we can express
        this as</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="eq4">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} I_1(x)\wedge

            <span class="equation-number">(4)</span>
          </div>
        </div>where we combine the CQs <em>I<sub>i</sub></em>
        (<em>x</em>) for the inclusion criteria and
        <em>E<sub>j</sub></em> (<em>x</em>) for the exclusion
        criteria using the logical connectives
        <em>and</em>&nbsp;(∧) and <em>not</em>&nbsp;(¬).
        <p></p>
        <p>This can lead to problems, since sometimes a diagnosis
        is not stated in a patient's admission simply because it is
        irrelevant for the primary reason of the admission. For
        example, consider looking for patients with
        <em>“Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)”</em>. In
        contrast to cancer or diabetes, PTSD is not relevant for
        many hospital admissions and is therefore likely to be
        omitted in most cases. Indeed, patient&nbsp;9248 (among
        many others) from MIMIC-III has five recorded admissions
        over a period of three years, and PTSD is listed as
        diagnosis only in the 2nd and 4th admissions, but not in
        the 1st, 3rd or 5th. This is problematic when evaluating
        <em>exclusion criteria</em>, since we can never be certain
        about the <em>absence</em> of a disease. From a formal
        point of view, there is a similar problem: SNOMED&nbsp;CT
        is modeled in the DL <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathcal
        {EL}$</span></span> , which does not support negative
        statements. In other words, the query&nbsp;(<a class="eqn"
        href="#eq4">4</a>) will in general not yield any results
        over the (incomplete) patient data, even when augmented
        with SNOMED&nbsp;CT.</p>
        <p>An obvious solution is to ask only for patients for
        which the data actually indicates that they satisfy an
        exclusion criterion (which is an under-approximation), and
        then remove these patients from the query results (which
        yields an over-approximation). This can be modeled by
        adding the so-called epistemic
        operator&nbsp;<strong>K</strong> (for “knowledge”), as
        investigated in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>], to our query language. We can
        then ask for patients that satisfy all inclusion criteria,
        and for which we <em>do not know</em> for certain that they
        satisfy any exclusion criteria:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="eq5">

            <span class="equation-number">(5)</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>In addition, negation also appears <em>inside</em>
        single criteria, for example in <em>“cancer other than skin
        cancer,”</em><a class="fn" href="#fn11" id=
        "foot-fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> which can only be expressed
        as a combination of positive and negative statements that
        refer to the same existentially quantified variable:</p>

            <span class="equation-number">(6)</span>
          </div>
        </div>However, this is not a CQ anymore, and adding
        negation inside of CQs quickly leads to
        undecidability&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. It should be possible to extend
        CQs by <em>epistemic negation</em> ¬<strong>K</strong>
        similar to&nbsp;(<a class="eqn" href="#eq5">5</a>) while
        staying decidable (but this particular combination of CQs
        and epistemic negation has not been investigated so far).
        In this way, we can obtain all patients that have a
        diagnosis&nbsp;<em>y</em> that is a cancer diagnosis, for
        which it is not explicitly stated in the EHR that this
        cancer is a skin cancer.

        <p>To access temporal patient data, where all diagnoses are
        annotated with time stamps, we propose to use <em>temporal
        conjunctive queries (TCQs)</em>&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>], in which CQs are
        combined with linear-temporal operators. As a simple
        example, with a TCQ we can ask for all patients that have a
        <em>“history of cancer,”</em><a class="fn" href="#fn12" id=
        "foot-fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> i.e., those that were
        diagnosed with cancer <em>at some point in the past</em>,
        using the temporal operator&nbsp;◊:</p>

          </div>
        </div>where the time interval (− ∞, 0] refers to the whole
        history (relative to the current time point&nbsp;0). More
        complex queries include <em>“type 1 diabetes with duration
        at least 12 months,”</em><a class="fn" href="#fn13" id=
        "foot-fn13"><sup>13</sup></a> utilizing the temporal

        for which during the whole time interval [ − 12, 0]
        relative to&nbsp;<em>t</em> (that is, [<em>t</em> − 12,
        <em>t</em>]) the patient had a diagnosis of diabetes (such
        specific time intervals are not supported by TCQs yet, but
        have been investigated in other settings&nbsp;[<a class=

        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]). Here,
        we used months as the basic time unit; in practice,
        statements with a different temporal granularity like
        <em>days</em> or <em>years</em> have to be converted into a
        common time unit before combining them into a logical
        query.
        <p></p>
        <p>In general we can distinguish two different kinds of
        temporal queries: (<a class="eqn" href=
        "#eq6">7</a>)&nbsp;asks whether there exists a
        <em>single</em> point in time at which something is true,
        while (<a class="eqn" href="#eq7">8</a>)&nbsp;asks whether
        something was true for the <em>whole</em> duration of a
        given interval. Since the data is restricted to the times
        where the patient was in the hospital, for the latter kind
        of queries we need to make additional assumptions about
        what happens in between admissions. Did the patient still
        suffer from diabetes? Maybe the disease was healed and
        after some time reappeared? In the specific case
        of&nbsp;(<a class="eqn" href="#eq7">8</a>), medical
        knowledge tells us that diabetes cannot (yet) be cured,
        which means that it suffices to find patients diagnosed
        with diabetes at least 12 months ago. In principle, such
        knowledge can be encoded in the setting proposed
        in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>,

        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>].
        Unfortunately, currently there does not exist a formalized
        ontology containing information on the usual duration and
        the curability of diseases, which means that for now such
        information would have to be hand-coded for each clinical
        trial.</p>
        <p>Similar to&nbsp;(<a class="eqn" href="#eq7">8</a>),
        consider the following criterion: <em>“Temperature &gt;
        38.5 °</em>C for seven consecutive days within the 14 days
        prior to first study dose:”<a class="fn" href="#fn14" id=

          </div>
        </div>The statement <em>y</em> &gt; 38.5 °<em>C</em> is
        discussed in more detail in the next section. For now, we
        focus on the problem of finding valid continuous intervals
        when given only single measurements. The availability of
        body temperature measurements varies from patient to
        patient: When a patient stays in an ICU, the temperature is
        measured frequently, whereas outside the ICU it may not be
        measured at all.
        <p></p>
        <p>One strategy to interpolate the values in between
        measurements could be to assume them to be constant until
        the next measurement. This might be a good approach if the
        measurements are a few hours apart, but certainly not if
        they are years apart. It is difficult to define intervals
        in which values stay the same, since it strongly depends on
        the context. Moreover, this would again require medical
        background knowledge that is currently not available in a
        logical form.</p>
        <p>An approximation that does not require background
        knowledge is based on the assumption that abnormal values,
        such as a raised temperature or decreased red blood cell
        count, will be measured more frequently. Therefore, we can
        over-approximate&nbsp;(<a class="eqn" href="#eq8">9</a>) by
        looking for an interval of 7&nbsp;days during which</p>

            <span class="equation-number">(10)</span>
          </div>
        </div>Here, the temporal component is also important: We do
        not consider an arbitrary measurement, but rather we want
        to find the most recent one that can still be considered
        valid (see the discussion in the previous section).
        <p></p>
        <p>Sometimes value comparisons are explicitly combined with
        temporal expressions, e.g., when talking about aggregated
        values over a given interval. As an example, consider
        <em>“any previous treatment with sodium fluoride at daily
        doses ≥ &nbsp;5 mg/day for a period exceeding
        1&nbsp;month.”</em><a class="fn" href="#fn16" id=
        "foot-fn16"><sup>16</sup></a> To answer the query, it is
        necessary to find a prescription of sodium fluoride with a
        daily sum greater or equal to 5&nbsp;mg, which also
        includes taking 2.5&nbsp;mg sodium fluoride twice a day.
        Unfortunately, adding arithmetic expressions beyond simple
        value comparisons to a DL quickly results in high
        computational complexity or even undecidability of the
        logic. To work around this limitation, we need to employ a
        preprocessor that normalizes all numbers in the patient
        data.</p>

        <p>There are a number of criteria that simply cannot be

        not contribute anything to the query, while in the worst
        case they could introduce errors. In a working system,
        these criteria should be marked to indicate to the doctor
        that they are still open and need to be checked

      <p>Previous work has already considered using ontologies for
      patient selection for clinical trials before. Patel
      et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>] worked with patient records from
      Columbia University Medical Center that were recorded using
      the MED ontology. They mapped MED to SNOMED&nbsp;CT using a
      semi-automated approach that was guided by domain experts.
      The patient records were then integrated using a pattern
      matching rule-based approach. They showed impressively that
      it is actually possible to find patient matches using an
      ontology, and were able to scale their approach to one year
      of patient data.</p>
      <p>Besana et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] focused on 200 trials about prostate
      cancer and annotated them manually with UMLS concepts. As
      formal basis, they use OWL (which is based on DLs) together
      with SWRL rules, which allows them to add rules for temporal
      relations. They then load one patient at a time into the
      ontology and query the studies that the patient is eligible
      for. Their approach allows traceability of the results, which
      is a very desirable property. While they demonstrate that
      patients can be selected using their formal framework, they
      assume that the data are already formalized.</p>
      <p>Tao et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>] further analyzed and modeled the
      temporal patterns that occur in patient data. To represent
      them they introduce the OWL-based CNTRO&nbsp;2.0 ontology for
      clinical narratives. Later, Crowe and Tao [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>] classified most temporal
      statements occurring in descriptions of clinical trials and
      clinical guidelines into 16 basic temporal patterns that are
      expressible in CNTRO&nbsp;2.0. Unfortunately, CNTRO&nbsp;2.0
      is not suitable for temporal query answering, since it can
      express temporal statements, but does not provide a temporal
      semantics and allows only rudimentary temporal
      inferences.</p>
      <p>Other approaches to model temporal medical data use graph-
      or constraint-based formalisms to representing and reasoning

      </header>
      <p>Automated patient recruitment is an important and at the
      same time challenging task. In this paper we have presented
      the issues involved when representing EHRs and eligibility
      criteria for clinical trials in a formal knowledge
      representation system that supports effective reasoning. We
      have seen that the support for temporal operators plays a
      crucial role in representing the data and the criteria in a
      concise way. In addition, epistemic negation, bounded
      temporal intervals like [0, 12], and concrete domains are
      desirable means of expressiveness in this setting, but also
      in many other real-world scenarios with incomplete data.</p>
      <p>In the future, we aim to develop effective procedures that
      enable automated reasoning over knowledge expressed in this
      way. While answering TCQs has been addressed in our previous
      work (e.g., [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]), query
      answering for extensions of TCQs that support epistemic
      negation, bounded temporal intervals, and concrete domains
      have not been investigated until now. On the theoretical
      side, we intend to investigate the decidability and
      complexity of the corresponding decision problems. On the
      practical side, our aim is to build a prototype system that
      demonstrates the applicability of this kind of temporal
      reasoning for selecting patients for clinical trials.
      Additional important features of such a system include,
      firstly, perspicuity of the automatically computed results:
      for each patient that is marked as eligible or not eligible,
      the system should be able to explain why this is the case.
      Secondly, in cases with no exact matches, we suggested to
      return patients that only partially satisfy the criteria. To
      support the recruiters, the returned list of possibly
      eligible patients should then be ranked by its degree of
      certainty or significance [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>]. In addition, the properties missing
      for an exact match should be explicated.</p>
      <p>Another important topic for future research is tackling
      the problem of (semi-)automatically translating natural
      language descriptions of eligibility criteria into formal
      queries w.r.t. a given medical ontology.</p>
