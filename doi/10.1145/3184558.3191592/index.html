        <p><small>In this paper, we study the posting behavior of
        OSN users, in particular the posting frequency and temporal
        patterns, and consider possible interpretations of how
        users use the platform. At the aggregate (macro) level, we
        find two distinct peaks, one during morning working hours,
        and one in the evening. The morning peak is more pronounced
        for frequent posters, while the evening peak is pronounced
        for the remaining users. We postulate that this difference
        results from qualitatively different usage of the OSN
        platform (e.g. for work, with customers, etc.) than purely
        social interactions (e.g., friends, family, etc.). We also
        study user posting behavior at an individual (micro) level
        and apply LDA to cluster user temporal patterns and
        interpret our results. Our study provides new insights into
        user activity in today's OSNs, and suggests a framework for
        profiling users based on their posting activities. In the
        process, we provide a novel application of LDA, to temporal
        user posting behavior by equating the time epochs of posts
        to words in documents. We believe our approach will
        complement other methods of user profiling based on static
        demographic information and friendship network
        information.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Over the past decade, several Online social network (OSN)
      platforms have amassed millions, if not billions, of monthly
      active users (MAUs). As the number of platforms have
      expanded, the usage patterns and purposes have also evolved
      significantly. In addition to traditional social
      communication with friends or family, OSNs are increasingly
      being used for workplace interactions, news/media
      consumption, opinion sharing, brand development and as
      commercial marketplaces. While some platforms (e.g.,
      Pinterest) are exclusively used for certain functional
      purposes, other large platforms (e.g., Twitter) contain users
      with varied motives. These varied motives often reflect in
      the users’ behavioral patterns on the platform. In this
      paper, we consider the following question: Given the diverse
      intents and purposes, what can we tell from users’ behavior
      patterns, in particular posting patterns?</p>
      <p>In order to address this question, we collected a random
      sample of 10000 anonymized users from Tencent social platform
      (China's largest OSN platform), and the ego network of these
      users comprising of a total of 1,107,782 users for our study.
      We also collected the time series of their posting activity
      (but not the content of their posts) within a twelve weeks
      period. In this paper, we study what we can observe based on
      the temporal and frequency of posting behaviors.</p>
      <p>First, we analyze the aggregate posting behavior,at
      different time scales, such as weekly and daily trends. The
      most interesting observation is that there are two peaks for
      posting during a typical day: one in the morning during work
      hours and one in the evening. Furthermore, for users with the
      higher posting frequency, the morning peak is more
      pronounced. We also apply spectral analysis using the
      autocorrelation function to identify the periodicity of the
      posting time series. Then we study the individual posting
      behaviors, to discover common patterns among users. In
      particular, propose a novel application of LDA (Latent
      Dirichlit Allocation), an algorithm popular for text document
      topic modeling, to cluster temporal posting behavior
      patterns.</p>
      <p>The organization of the paper is as follows. We begin with
      an overview of related work, and then describe the dataset
      with some background about the social network platform. We
      then present the main results pertaining to posting timings.
      In our conclusions, besides summarizing our findings, we also
      briefly discuss our on-going work and future directions
      related to this paper.</p>

        <p>The topic of social networks has received a lot of
        attention in the computer science research community for
        more than two decades&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=

        "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. Today's OSNs allow for a diverse
        set of activities than the mutual social communication and
        content exchange&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>].</p>
        <p>In recent years, there has been renewed interest in
        understnading the dynamics and temporal patterns of user
        activity on these platforms. &nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>] studied the patterns of
        user content generation, especially posting counts,
        frequency, and the temporal patterns. They showed that
        users’ posting behavior in the popular knowledge-sharing
        OSNs exhibits strong daily and weekly patterns.

        demonstrated that total post count of users follow power
        law like function, and discuss some outliers. Some outliers
        are identified based on temporal patterns, but the authors
        do not attempt to profile users based on their temporal
        posting patterns.</p>

        content and derive the shapes characterizing the different
        types of media. Moreover, &nbsp;[<a class="bib"

        query frequency and clicked URLs over time. The temporal
        modeling framework adapted from physics and signal
        processing have been used to unearth several properties
        observed in online user behavior, including trend,
        periodicity, noise, surprise, and seasonality detection.
        Furthermore, the more recent work of &nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

        patterns of the content changes of three major news
        websites, using spectral analysis of the autocorrelation
        function to identify the periodicity. In this paper, we use
        similar approaches to detect periodicity of user posting
        patterns.</p>

        <p>Latent topic analysis has emerged as one of the most
        effective methods for classifying, clustering and
        retrieving textual data&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=

        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>]. Many previous papers have applied
        topic modeling to study users’ temporal online behavior,
        but most algorithms still relied on the text data
        &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=

        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>]. In the work of &nbsp;[<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>], a
        temporal topic model was proposed for efficiently mining
        streams of social text such as a Twitter stream for an
        author, by modeling the topics and topic temporal
        transitions. Moreover, the work of &nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>] hypothesizes posting is
        generated by three factors: news, social, self-interest. It
        then builds an LDA model to capture these factors, which is
        based on the text content of posts. In some circumstance
        lacking of textual data, authors first built abstraction or
        categories of users access content before applying the LDA
        model. &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] develop a hierarchical URL
        dictionary generated from Yahoo! Directory and a
        cross-hierarchical matching method of automatic
        abstraction. This paper also desbribe the “topics” as
        intentions of users’ next search action. While these topics
        are transient, in our paper we are interested in extracting
        the user's purpose for maintaining their OSN account. Other
        conventional studies apply topic modeling to clustering
        sequences of temporal activity&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>], but the premise is
        knowing the symbols or features of activity. However,
        little previous work was found to map time instant as
        ”words” instead of features. From this perspective, our
        paper is the first work to model user purposes of posting
        behavior in OSNs by applying the topic modeling to their
        temporal posting sequences, without disclosing the content
        of the activity.</p>

        <p>In this paper we use a dataset collected from the
        Tencent social platform. The dataset contains a randomly
        sampled set of 10K users (with anaonymized user IDs). Each
        record contains the user and the user's neighbors, in other
        words the user's ego network. Since users are sampled from
        a much larger pool, these ego networks are relatively
        disjoint from each other. We refer to each sampled user as
        <em>ego</em>, and the neighbors of the ego as
        <em>alters</em>. With the sampled egos and their neighbors,
        the dataset covers a total of 1,107,782 users.</p>

        <p>In order to understand the context the data comes from,
        we briefly explain the Tencent<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=

        Tencent's original online social network is called QQ. It
        provides messaging and music streaming service to more than
        840 million users. In 2011, a new social network
        application called WeChat was introduced, and it has become
        the most popular OSN platform provided by Tencent, with
        more than 980 monthly million active users. It has become a
        platform of serving different functions, including
        messaging, voice calls, group chatting, and commercial
        transactions. A user can add a friend by scanning the
        QR-code version of one's ID. Besides the ability to have a
        private messaging exchange with a friend, a user can also
        post a variety of content (text, photos, videos, links) to
        share with their friends. A user can see all the postings
        from friends in chronological order on a page called
        <em>Moments</em>. When a user comments (or likes) an entry
        in that user's <em>Moments</em>, it can only be seen by the
        author of the content and their mutual friends.</p>

        extract the posting behavior as a time series, for temporal

      <p>A user builds a virtual persona within the online social
      network through the friends he/she connects to and interacts
      with, and the content he/she posts on the platform. The
      activities performed by the user on the platform, do serve a
      latent purpose, which may include (a) connecting with
      friends/family, (b) promoting information spread or (c)
      advertising and selling products. The demographics
      information used traditionally to profile users in OSNs may
      not reveal these latent purposes. In this paper, we propose
      to profile users based on their posting activities. This
      assumes that there is a relationship between a user's purpose
      and his/her posting activities, so that we can learn the

        users made nearly 80% posts, thus demonstrating the 80-20
        or the Pareto rule. In order to understand the user

        <p>Next, we analyze the temporal pattern of users’ posting
        activity. Each post reports a timestamp indicating the
        posting time. We sum up all posts on hourly basis over the
        period of study, i.e., 84 days. Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig"
        href="#fig2">2</a> shows this aggregate distribution of
        posts over 24 hours. We find that the distribution has two
        peaks: one at 1000 hrs (morning peak) and the other at
        2100hrs (evening peak). The morning peak has slightly more
        traffic than the evening peak, which is different than
        conventional wisdom&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. On the other hand, the lowest
        traffic rate occurs at 0400hrs, which is not surprising.
        Another trough occurs at 1600hrs. The more pronounced
        morning peak traffic rate is surprising, compared to the
        previous study of OSNs. Based on the measurement results of
        a blog system &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], user generated content (UGC) such
        as blog articles show an increasing hourly pattern from
        morning to evening and only has a peak traffic in the
        evening. TThis could indicate a trend in the use of current
        OSN platforms:</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list1" label="•">Increased usage of mobile
          phones, allow users to check their OSN during their
          morning commutes, and before work.<br /></li>
          <li id="list2" label="•">Since today's OSNs support
          diverse functions, besides social communication, the
          morning work hours are a natural time to post content for
          people who use OSN for work. Such posts may be for
          distributing information, or posting daily product
          promotions.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In other words, our hypothesis is that OSN these days
        are used for both functional purposes as well as social
        purposes. Much of the former activities naturally occur in
        the working hours, especially in the morning.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>We look further into the correlation between users’
        posting frequency and their hourly pattern. We separate
        users into six groups by their post count in the
        observation period: [1, 50] [50, 100] [100, 300] [300, 500]
        [500, 1000] [1000+], and plot the hourly pattern of each
        group in Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>.
        For users with fewer posts, the evening peak is more
        pronounced than the morning peak. As we move to the group
        of users with more posts, the morning peak is more
        pronounced. Further, the timing of the evening peak occurs
        earlier (from 2200hrs to 1900hrs).</p>
        <p>Based on our preliminary study, we believe the reason
        for the movement of the traffic peak time is correlated the
        purposes why the users operate OSN accounts. Users who post
        less than 50 times in three months (less than one post
        everyday) are less likely to be posting for information
        spreading or product promotion purposes; and these users
        are more likely to post in the evening (e.g. 9pm) and
        during lunch break (around noon), which are non-working
        hours. In the other extreme, users who post more than 1000
        times (more than 10 posts everyday) are more likely posting
        something for functional intention, e.g. posting some
        product information for commercial reasons. The
        high-traffic users have a sharp morning peak and relatively
        low traffic in the evening. Thus we believe the hourly
        posting pattern can be a good feature for predicting users’
        purposes.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>In order to study the periodicity of the temporal
        posting pattern, we treat the aggregate posting count as a
        time series for 84 days, hence a time series <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\lbrace {Y_t}\rbrace
        =\lbrace {y_{t_1}},{y_{t_2}},\ldots
        {y_{t_N}}\rbrace$</span></span> , with <em>t</em>
        <sub>1</sub> ≤ <em>t</em> <sub>2</sub> ≤ … ≤
        <em>t<sub>N</sub></em> and <em>N</em> = 24 × 7 × 12 = 2016.
        The value of <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$y_{t_i}$</span></span> is the number of posts at
        <em>i<sup>th</sup></em> hour during the 84 days. We plot
        the time series of the first two weeks in
        Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>. We can
        observe the periodicity exhibited by this time series, at
        hourly, daily and weekly periods.</p>
        <p>To identify the periodicity of the time series, we apply
        spectral analysis using the autocorrelation function. The
        autocorrelation function <em>R<sub>h</sub></em> at lag
        <em>h</em> is defined as &nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

            _{i=1}^{N-h}{({y_{t_i}}-\overline{y})({y_{t_{i+h}}}-\overline{y})}}{({y_{t_i}}-\overline{y})^2}

        <p></p>
        <p>where <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\overline{y}$</span></span> denotes the mean value
        of the time series. The function computed at varying time
        lags allows us to check the randomness of the data. If the
        autocorrelation is close to zero for any time lag, then the
        time series represents some random behavior, whereas if one
        or more values of time lag are significantly different from
        zero, they represent non-random behavior.</p>
        <p>We compute the autocorrelation functions with time lags
        varying from one hour up to one week (168 hours) and plot
        <em>R</em> in Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig5">5</a>. The plot shows repeated patterns, with
        almost the same magnitude. In particular, the test of
        independence performed at 5% significance level fails, as
        most of the values fall outside the 95% confidence bands
        delimited by the horizontal dashed lines, thus confirming
        the non-randomness of these patterns.</p>
        <p>The nature of the periodicity can be derived from the
        power spectrum of the autocorrelation functions. The
        discrete Fourier coefficients <em>f<sub>k</sub></em>
        associated with the <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\frac{k}{T}$</span></span> frequencies is calculated

          </div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p><em>T</em> refers to the observation interval of the
        time series. We plot the periodogram of
        <em>f<sub>k</sub></em> <sup>2</sup> as as a function of
        frequency in Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig6">6</a>. Here we choose <em>T</em> = 7 days. The
        highest peak lies on the frequency of <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\frac{7}{T}$</span></span> , which corresponds to
        daily period of one day. There is also a smaller peak lies
        on the frequency of <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\frac{14}{T}$</span></span> , which corresponds to
        12 hours. This period of 12 hours corresponds to the
        interval of two peaks in the daily posting pattern, that
        the morning peak and evening peak are separated by an
        interval of roughly 12 hours.</p>
        <p>From the analysis of periodicity, we find that the users
        as an aggregate population show regular hourly and daily
        periodic pattern, but weak weekly or monthly patterns (the
        long-term trend). These observation may allow us in the
        future to build models of population posting behavior based
        on this time series analysis, similar to &nbsp;[<a class=

      </header>
      <p>In section 4, we looked at macroscopic user posting
      behavior. In section 4.3, we found that users who have high
      posting frequency show different hourly pattern than those
      who have low posting frequency, which actually indicates
      significant difference in behavior at the individual level,
      or microscopic level. In this section, we study individual
      user's posting behaviors and identify their hidden
      patterns.</p>
      <p>As hinted earlier, the posting frequency to some extent
      reflects the latent purpose, i.e., why an individual operates
      an OSN account. A user who posts more than 10 items on their
      timeline each day is quite likely to have some functional
      intention (or purpose), compared to a typical social user who
      may only post less than 1 item daily. Also, these latent
      purposes tend to lead to specific temporal posting patterns,
      i.e., posting timings. Based on this intuition, we
      hypothesize we can learn users’ latent purpose by profiling
      and clustering users posting activities.</p>
      <p>We are inspired by the concept of topic modeling which is
      a powerful tool used in the text mining domain. In a typical
      topic model, documents are represented as a mixture of
      topics, where a topic is a probability distribution over
      words &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>].
      In our case, our model is that an individual user
      (“document”) has a mixture of purposes (“topics”) , and each
      purpose leads to a probability distribution over posting
      actions(“words”). The aim is to characterize each user by a
      probabilistic mixture of purposes. To realize it, we employ
      LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), a common topic modelling
      algorithm, to model the time series of use posting behavior.
      To distinguish from the traditional LDA in texting mining, we
      call our model (applying to time series) T-LDA.</p>

        <p>In most previous works that applied LDA to model user
        behavior, “words” are texts or abstract “categories”
        derived from texts. In our problem, we do not have the
        content or even categories of users’ posts. Instead, we
        divide the time over 24 hours into a sequence of discrete
        and relative time epochs (e.g. each epoch is an hour); so a
        topic is a bag of “timestamps” (in terms of epochs). The
        basic ingredients of LDA and their corresponding meaning in
        T-LDA are therefore:</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list3" label="•">Documents: users, each has a

          <li id="list5" label="•">Words: the timestamps of posts,
          in terms of discrete epochs, 00-23 hrs.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In our posting data, timestamps are in terms of hours,
        since the beginning of the measurement period. Formally,
        <em>U</em> indicates the set of users, <em>T</em> is the
        set of latent topics, <em>N<sub>u</sub></em> means the
        length of time series of user <em>u</em>, and <em>D</em> is
        the set of discretized times. It assumes a Dirichlet prior
        <em>β</em> for the topics and a Dirichlet prior <em>α</em>
        for the users. The generative process of an individual's
        hourly posting pattern is as follows:</p>

        <p>We first eliminated inactive users who posted fewer than
        5 times in the 3 months period. Then we ran LDA following
        &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>], which used online variational
        Bayes algorithm as the inference algorithm.</p>
        <p>We evaluate the optimality of the T-LDA model by
        perplexity, a common evaluation metric of clustering
        quality. Perplexity is a measure of the ability of a model
        to generalize documents. The definition of perplexity is as
        follows:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{gather*}
            perplexity=exp\lbrace -\frac{\sum _{m=1}^{U}{\log
            p(w_m^{test})}}{\sum _{m=1}^{U}N_m}\rbrace
            \nonumber\end{gather*}</span><br />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p><em>N<sub>m</sub></em> is the length of time series for
        user <em>m</em>, and <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$p(w_m^{test})$</span></span> denotes the predictive
        probability of a test word. A lower perplexity indicates
        better performance. Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig7">7</a> shows the results for the proposed model with
        different number of topics. The perplexity changes little
        after <em>K</em> &gt; 6.</p>

        <p>In the output topic-time matrix <em>Φ</em>, each row
        represents the topic's distribution over 24 hours. A
        straightforward way to visualize the topics is to plot the
        distribution of the row vectors. Considering the
        distribution of perplexity, we first plot the different
        topics when K=5 in Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig8">8</a>. Each curve plots the probability
        distribution over 24 hours, which reflects the hourly
        pattern of a topic, corresponding to a cluster of common
        user posting behavior. We make the following
        observations:</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li id="list11" label="•">Both Topic 1 and 2 have high
          morning peak traffic, but Topic 1 has peak at 7am to 8
          am, and Topic 2 has peak at 10 am to 11 am. These two
          topics capture user behaviors with high activity rate in
          the early morning and at the beginning of work
          hours.<br /></li>
          <li id="list12" label="•">Topic 3 and 4 represents user
          posting patterns with high activity rates in the evening.
          The hourly pattern of Topic 3 is similar to the typical
          pattern in the previous study of OSNs&nbsp;[<a class=
          "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
          data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], which
          is consistent of posting more during leisure time of a
          day. And Topic 4 shows an increasing activity rate from
          daytime to nighttime and reaches the peak at 8pm.<br />
          </li>
          <li id="list13" label="•">Topic 0 shows rather abnormal
          hourly pattern, contradicting most users’ natural daily
          activity pattern. From checking manually, we find this
          pattern belongs to a very small number of users who
          repeat exactly the same temporal pattern every day; so we
          believe that they may not be generated by human
          activity.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a comparison for the case of five topics (K=5), we
        also plot the results of K=3 in Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig"
        href="#fig9">9</a>. This time, Topic 0 of
        Figure.&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig8">8</a> is no longer
        detected, and Topic3 is merged into Topic 1. Obviously,
        some details are omitted in the K=3 case. The parameter K,
        as we can see, plays a key role in controlling the right
        number of topics to be discovered.</p>

      </header>
      <p>Our overall objective is to understand user behavior in
      online social networks, especially their posting patterns and
      how it relates to their latent purpose of using the platform.
      A great deal of past literature studied community detection,
      leveraging the socializing behavior of OSNs to discover
      communities and hence users’ involvement in them. We believe
      today's OSN have become increasingly multi-functional, where
      users use OSN for work and business related purposes. It is
      an interesting research question to ask what we can learn
      about these users and their purposes based on less sensitive
      data, such as friend connectivity graph and activity event
      logs. In this paper, we focus on user posting data, and try
      to identify clusters of common temporal patterns of posting
      behavior. Our main contributions in this paper are the new
      insights based on the analysis of aggregate frequency and
      temporal posting behaviors that lead to plausible indications
      of functional versus social users. Our application of LDA to
      cluster temporal user behavioral patterns is novel and shed
      light on different common behavior patterns. Future
      extensions include validating the observations against some
      subset of users in our dataset manually tagged to be
      functional or social users. For future study, we are working
      towards combining multiple features including network
      connectivity, demographics and posting behavior to more
      accurately profile users.</p>
