        <p><small>With the continuing growth of the Internet
        landscape, users share large amount of personal, sometimes,
        privacy sensitive data. When doing so, often, users have
        little or no clear knowledge about what service providers
        do with the trails of personal data they leave on the
        Internet. While regulations impose rather strict
        requirements that service providers should abide by, the
        defacto approach seems to be communicating data processing
        practices through privacy policies. However, privacy
        policies are long and complex for users to read and
        understand, thus failing their mere objective of informing
        users about the promised data processing behaviors of
        service providers. To address this pertinent issue, we
        propose a machine learning based approach to summarize the
        rather long privacy policy into short and condensed notes
        following a risk-based approach and using the European
        Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
        aspects as assessment criteria. The results are promising
        and indicate that our tool can summarize lengthy privacy
        policies in a short period of time, thus supporting users
        to take informed decisions regarding their information
        disclosure behaviors.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Nowadays, The number of websites in the world wide web has
      reached over a billion [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>]. These websites are accessed by
      almost half of the world's population on daily basis. This
      has resulted in Internet services fundamentally changing the
      way we interact with each other. These on-line interactions
      also result in a huge amount of personal digital trails,
      which is being collected and processed by service providers,
      quite often with users being unaware of what data is being
      collected for what purpose. In the end, users are left
      without control of their own data, creating a huge
      information asymmetry in contrast to the service providers
      who have full access. To address this issue, regulatory
      bodies have devised compliance guidelines and
      responsibilities for service providers that aim to preserve
      user's informational self-determination rights. As such,
      privacy policies have emerged to be the de facto transparency
      boards that service providers use to communicate their
      information processing practices.</p>
      <p>While privacy policies also function as legal agreements
      between service providers and their users [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>], a number of studies have
      shown that these documents suffer from bad readability
      indexes [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. In
      effect, users rarely read these documents, mainly due to
      their complexity, use of technical jargons and excessive
      length. Reading privacy policies is not only cumbersome, but
      it also consumes a lot of time that would cause tremendous
      harm to the economy. McDonald and Cranor [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] showed in 2008 that if a
      user was to read the privacy policy of every service she
      visits on the Internet, she would, on average, need 244 hours
      annually which is slightly more than half of the average time
      a user would spend on the Internet by then. This becomes even
      more complicated and time consuming in today's Internet
      services infrastructure, where the number of on-line services
      has more than doubled since then and data is also shared with
      ”<em>third parties</em>” which have their own different
      privacy policies [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]. E.g., an excerpt from CNN's
      <a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>
      rather long privacy policy states: ”Some of our Sites contain
      links to or integrations with other sites such as Facebook,
      Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., whose information practices may be
      different than ours. <em>Visitors should consult the other
      sites’ privacy notices</em> as we have no control over
      information that is submitted to, or collected by, these
      third parties.”</p>
      <p>While the Internet continues to grow, service providers
      and other data processors are continuously being challenged
      to abide by data protection regulations. One such regulation
      is the newly adopted European Union (EU) General Data
      Protection Regulation (GDPR) [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. The GDPR takes, among other things,
      transparency and user consent as core components wherein the
      responsibilities of the data processor and the rights of the
      user are specified. Especially, article 13 emphasizes on the
      way information that must be provided to the data subject at
      the time their personal data is collected has to be
      presented. Similarly, article 12 states that information must
      be provided in <em>”a concise, transparent, intelligible and
      easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in
      particular for any information addressed specifically to a
      child”</em>. Our motivation in this work is, thus, mainly
      influenced by the GDPR and newly emerging techniques of
      machine learning. We aim to support Internet users by
      simplifying privacy policies’ readability. We take the
      requirements stated in the GDPR as a basis and provide a
      privacy policy benchmarking tool that considers privacy
      aspects and through the use of risk indicators we draw users’
      attention to the most relevant parts of the privacy policy.
      To achieve this, we introduce a categorization of data based
      on the interpretation of the GDPR and propose a risk based
      approach to privacy policy benchmarking. We use supervised
      machine learning techniques to classify the lengthy privacy
      policies and employ a three scale risk based categorization.
      As a result we simplify the interpretation of the privacy
      policy and draw users attention to the proposed risk
      indicators.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The privacy aspects of the EU GDPR needed to be
        interpreted before they could be used as assessment
        criteria for privacy policies. While the EU GDPR is the
        legal boundary of privacy policies, it does not reflect the
        wording and formulation that is commonly used. Research
        works such as Costante <em>et al.</em> [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] have defined their
        privacy aspects mainly based on regulations, however,
        others used empirical techniques like quantitative user
        studies [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>] or qualitative expert interviews
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>]. For the
        definition of classification categories, we adapted the
        privacy aspects of the EU GDPR based on combinations of
        definitions of the aspects (cf. Figure <a class="fig" href=
        "#fig1">1</a>). Article 9 is specifically used to asses how
        service providers promise to treat specially privacy
        sensitive information types.</p>

        <p>Once the main categories were defined, a set of
        application privacy policies were analyzed by a group of
        privacy experts, as a result, three risk levels for each of
        the categories were determined.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Supervised machine learning techniques take as an input
        a training data set that must be manually labelled
        beforehand, so that afterwards the algorithm can generalize
        and classify further input data of similar nature. Thus, in
        order to build up the ’privacy corpus’, 45 privacy policies
        were collected taking into consideration the 45 most
        <em>accessed websites in Europe according to the results
        provided by Alexa.com</em>.</p>
        <p>In order to perform the manual labeling task, 35
        participants were recruited: 68,57% male and 31.43% female,
        all of them with at least bachelor degree, and ages ranging
        between 21 and 29 years old. They were provided with a
        description of the task, detailed instructions and
        explanations for each of the eleven categories and their a
        potential risk level (including descriptive examples).
        Finally, to facilitate the labeling task, they were
        provided with an annotation form with drop-downs and text
        passages describing the categories. On average, each
        participant extracted 1266 text passages from a single
        privacy policy, resulting on 443 text passages assigned to
        a privacy category and classified with a risk level.</p>

        <p>The choice of a perfect Machine Learning algorithm for a
        specific task remains unanswered by the research community.
        Related studies have therefore focused on creating
        algorithm portfolios from which they choose the best
        performing ones [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]. Since, the problem space is
        intuitively a classification one, we defined a multi-class
        approach (i.e., eleven privacy aspects and three associated
        risks levels for each of the categories), and four well
        known classifiers namely: Naive Bayes, Support Vector
        Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest that
        fulfill this criteria were implemented (cf. Figure
        <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>). The source code can
        also be found in a Github repository<a class="fn" href=
        "#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Certain privacy
        sentences may also fall into more than one category, thus
        we also implemented the Binary Relevance multi-label
        classification technique. We then compared the results
        using established evaluation metrics, i.e., precision,
        recall and finally f-measure as weighted harmonic average
        of both.</p>

        the resulting evaluation (risk level); and, a detailed
        information level, providing the privacy aspect
        description, meaning of the risk level, and finally, the

      <p>Before building the final model, we ran experiments on the
      four algorithms (cf. Section <a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-11">2.4</a>). While Naive Bayes and SVM seem to be
      robust in the available training and testing data, Decision
      Tree and Random Forest showed low precision. This could be
      due to both the size of the training data and presence of
      some ”noise” in it.</p>
      <p>Naive Bayes and SVM have relatively similar performance.
      However, SVM takes more time compared to Naive Bayes, thus,
      the final model and the results indicated in Table <a class=
      "tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> and Figure <a class="fig" href=
      "#fig2">2</a> (b) are based on the Naive Bayes classifier.
      Furthermore, Naive Bayes performed even better in the risk
      classification phase resulting in average f-measure of 90%
      across the aspects.</p>

      long it would take an average user to finish reading a
      privacy policy, PrivacyGuide summarizes the privacy policies
      in a short period of time, helping users save a significant
      amount of time. Nevertheless, the time that is needed for
      loading a privacy policy can be affected by a variety of
      external reasons like: the websites’ response time, the
      Internet connection, the bandwidth, the amount of content
      that is displayed on the same page and many more. Further
      observations show that despite the requirements in the GDPR
      for data breach notifications, our assessments showed that
      none of the Internet services we analyzed have plans for
      privacy breach notification (cf. Table <a class="tbl" href=
      "#tab1">1</a> data breach notification results).</p>

      <p>In summary, the benefits of the PrivacyGuide results are
      two fold: 1) supporting users in assessing or interpreting
      privacy policies; 2) providing actionable insights for
      service providers with respect to their privacy policies.
      Moreover, it can also trigger discussions among data
      protection officers, lawyers, privacy lobbyists, and other
      interested entities.</p>

          Limitations and Future Works</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p><em>Demonstration:</em>. During the demo session, we will
      showcase how the tool can extract privacy policy content from
      a given Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Furthermore, we will
      also demonstrate how the privacy policy is benchmarked using
      machine learning based on the EU GDPR aspects as criteria.
      The tool presents a risk-based, condensed and easy to
      understand summary of lengthy privacy policies in short
      period of time. We use user-friendly icons and colors to
      indicate the associated risk and draw user's attention. A
      screen cast of the tool is available on Youtube <a class="fn"
      href="#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The tool is
      tested to work on Macbook Pro OS X Yosemite 2.3 GHz Intel
      Core i7, and Microsoft Surface Pro 3 device with Windows 10
      Pro OS, 8GB RAM, Intel Core i5-4300U CPU @ 1.90 GHz (Boost:
      2.50 Ghz) and ADSL 2+ Internet connection. It requires a
      stable Internet connection to extract the privacy policy from
      target web services.</p>
      <p><em>Limitations:</em>. While this paper takes important
      steps towards building a stable tool that summarizes lengthy
      privacy policies in a short period of time, we also
      acknowledge that there are certain limitations, particularly:
      1) PrivacyGuide works for privacy policies in English
      language only; 2) at its current phase, it works as stand
      alone tool, which in itself might have privacy gains, but it
      also presents some challenges with respect to model updating;
      3) PrivacyGuide provides important insights about service
      provider's promises, however, as with any machine learning
      model, there are false positives and false negatives in the
      classification process. Thus, the tool should be taken as
      supportive but non-biding input for decisions. <em>Future
      works:</em>. We envision to enhance the prediction accuracy
      of PrivacyGuide by enlarging the privacy policy corpus and
      also experimenting with machine learning techniques that can
      better grasp the semantics of the privacy policy text, e.g.,
      using word embeddings and deep learning techniques.
      Furthermore, we also plan to run usability and user adoption
      studies. Last but not least, we envisage to build a holistic
      information privacy enhacing framework composed of (1)
      PrivacyGuide; (2) default privacy preference setting
      prediction engine [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]; and (3) unintended information
      disclosure detection and quantification component [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
