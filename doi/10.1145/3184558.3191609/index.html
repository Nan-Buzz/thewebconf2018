          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In the last years a shift occurred in the context of
      health-care, which changed its focus from the treatment of
      diseases to their <em>prevention</em>, promoting better
      awareness of health in the general public. New technologies
      evolved accordingly, developing devices which claim to
      improve the quality of life, by helping people to modify
      unhealthy behaviors and aiding them to quantify their
      activities, gaining awareness of their life-style.</p>
      <p>Body sensors, fitness trackers, smart watches and smart
      phones are light, easy to use and available at affordable
      prices, thus users can wear them (or simply bring them into
      their pocket) and start monitoring their daily
      activities.</p>
      <p>Wearable activity monitors and their companion
      applications –e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin, Samsung Gear
      Fit, to cite some of them– not only measure physical
      activity, but also can provide personalized feedbacks on
      other aspects of health, i.e., heart rate, calories intake
      and consumption, weight, and sleep patterns [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>], and they translate this
      data into health information; new devices often include
      multiple charts, <em>social comparisons</em>, and indicators
      of progress towards individual goals [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]. The collected data are
      then analyzed, providing instantaneous and predictive
      insights to users [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] which are now able to quantify their
      actions and adjust them accordingly. For example, nowadays
      many worldwide public health problems (e.g., obesity) may
      occur due to the lack of physical activity. Small increases
      in activity could lead to positive impacts on noncommunicable
      conditions, i.e., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases
      and several cancers [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. Thus, an healthy diet and
      exercising regularly can be considered modifiable risk
      factors, and the new wearable technologies can help (or at
      least, motivate) their users to keep an healthy life-style,
      reducing the global burden of noncommunicable diseases
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. For the
      aforementioned reasons, wearable activity monitors are
      generally seen in a positive way, both from the scientific
      community and by the general public. Some issues related to
      the privacy of the shared data may arise, but the positive
      social impact of these new technologies blurs them
      quickly.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, in this work we want to highlight some
      negative aspects that may arise from the misuse of wearable
      activity trackers and their combination with social media. We
      want to stress the social and ethical impact that these
      technologies can have, in particular regarding their
      potential abuse. As Bauman suggested, in fact, nowadays the
      terms “health” and “fitness” are used synonymously, but while
      being <em>healthy</em> is something objective and measurable,
      “fitness stays permanently open on the side of ‘more’: it
      does not refer to any particular standard of bodily capacity,
      but to its (preferably unlimited) potential of expansion.”

      <p>The paper is structured as follows. Section <a class="sec"
      href="#sec-4">2</a> introduces the context of wearable
      technologies for health monitoring and highlights the related
      social and ethical issues which have been already addresses
      by scholars. Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-5">3</a>
      presents three Black Mirror inspired dystopian scenarios of
      application, while Section <a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-12">4</a> ends the paper and proposes some actions that
      could help to prevent the aforementioned scenarios.</p>

      <p>Wearable sensors play an important role in the medical
      research community, where they are already used in several
      fields, as e.g. patient tracking, rehabilitation,
      telemonitoring and surveillance of patients, assisted living,
      and so on [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. These
      sensors can classify activities performed by the person who's
      wearing them with a very fine granularity: in fact, sensors
      can recognize not only physical activities, e.g. running,
      climbing stairs, or swimming, but also very mundane
      activities as well, e.g., reading, brushing teeth, writing,
      and so on [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>].</p>
      <p>At the same time, the commercial fitness device market is
      flourishing, and such devices have been received positively
      by the research community as a medium which could drive
      better health and lifestyle habits [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>], even if they are less
      powerful or precise as the ones that health care
      professionals use. For example, personalized suggestions
      generated by fitness applications are effective in improving
      their users habits, e.g., by encouraging them to exercise
      more or to eat healthier [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>].</p>
      <p>The challenges perceived by the research community,
      however, seem to be more technical than ethical. For example,
      when deploying wearable sensors one must enforce their
      security, that their battery lasts long enough, that there is
      enough bandwidth to reliably transfer data, or simply that
      the sensor is easy and unobtrusive to wear [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>].</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, wearable sensors pose significant ethical
      concerns. First, privacy of the users is at risk, since a
      huge body of sensitive data could be continuously collected
      and transmitted over the Internet. Second, fitness devices
      could undermine free, individual choices and independence,
      for example by producing “dependent, learning behavior” in
      their users [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>].
      Finally, it's worth addressing the cost of personal fitness
      or health devices. Allen and Christie [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] warn that “populations who
      stand to benefit the most from these technologies are unable
      to afford, access, or use them”, so the emergence of this
      market could lead to greater inequalities between people who
      can afford to buy wearable fitness devices, and people who
      can not.</p>

      in true Black Mirror spirit, push the fitness request of our
      society at its limits. We want to stress that the
      technologies that could enable their realization are already

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.1</span> Scenario 1:
            Alice's Insurance</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Let us imagine Alice as a woman in her middle 20s living
        in a suburban area in a Western country. Alice is not a
        wealthy woman; she comes from a low income family, so she
        did not have the possibility to attend top tier
        universities, because she had to pay for her studies
        herself; she even had to resort to students loans. Alice
        has just found her first job. However, she lives in a
        country where there is no national health care, so she must
        buy a health insurance, and in order to obtain it, she must
        pass a screening by insurance companies. She requires price
        quotations from three insurance companies: <em>A inc.</em>,
        <em>B ltd.</em>, and <em>C&amp;co</em>.</p>
        <p>The first company, called <em>A inc.</em>, used an
        automatic web crawler that scanned Alice's social media.
        Even if Alice seldom uses them, the company was able to
        identify the social accounts of her relatives. This allowed
        <em>A inc.</em> to find out that her mother has diabetes.
        Hence, the company required that Alice answers a
        questionnaire with various answers about her medical
        record. The company analyzed such answers with an automatic
        system, which predicts if she will be diagnosed with
        certain conditions within the next year. Unfortunately, the
        system predicted that she may be diagnosed with diabetes
        with an high probability. For this reason, the plan offered
        by <em>A inc.</em> is very costly, thus not affordable for
        Alice.</p>
        <p>The second company, <em>B ltd.</em>, uses automatic
        social media crawlers as well, but in a different manner.
        <em>B</em>’s scientists divided the country in small areas
        of 2500 square kilometers. Then, they scanned social
        networks for <em>geotagged</em> posts, i.e. posts
        containing the GPS position of the author. Using this data,
        they were able to build a statistical model of the country
        used to make certain assumptions. For example, they counted
        the appearance of the word <em>cancer</em> in posts, and
        they (arguably) correlated it with the incidence of actual
        cancer incidence in the area; i.e., if in an area many
        users spoke about cancer, <em>B</em> requires a premium
        assuming (arbitrarily) that in this area its customers
        where at higher risk of cancer. Moreover, <em>B</em> scans
        social media using <em>sentiment analysis</em> as well. In
        Alice's area, unfortunately, the higher than average
        aggressiveness of the population on social media suggests
        that there is an high risk of developing heart diseases.
        Again, this information is used by the insurance company to
        justify a very high quotation. Alice can't afford
        <em>B</em>’s insurance plan as well, so she is forced to
        resort to the last company's questionable practices.</p>
        <p><em>C&amp;co</em> insurance plan is, in fact, quite
        affordable for Alice. However, in order to obtain and
        maintain such a low price, <em>C&amp;co</em> enforces their
        customers to wear a wearable fitness device to track them,
        much like a plane's “black box”. If Alice subscribes to
        this plan, she is forced to exercise daily for at least 30
        minutes, twice a day, in order to stay fit and avoid the
        emergence of illnesses related to a sedentary lifestyle.
        Moreover, she is forced to compile an eating diary. In
        fact, <em>C&amp;co</em>’s social crawlers revealed her
        familiarity with diabetes, much like <em>A inc.</em>’s
        systems did. However, <em>C</em>’s approach is different:
        if Alice follows a diet suggested by the company, which
        supposedly should help her to avoid the emergence of the
        illness, they will let her pay less. However, the company
        does not blindly trust Alice: in fact, they will continue
        to scan her and her friends’ social media, in order to find
        eventual discrepancies between Alice's reported diet and
        her actual behavior. For example, a friend of Alice's
        tagging her at an ice cream parlor would be considered as a
        breach of contract, and in turn it will lead to an
        insurance price increase for the next year.</p>
        <p>Alice's choice is pretty limited. She can not afford
        <em>A inc.</em> and <em>B ltd.</em> plans.
        <em>C&amp;co</em>’s plan, while cheap, would require her a
        huge sacrifice, since she already spends over an hour and a
        half a day in commuting; so, she would have to subtract the
        time required to stay fit to her already scarce social
        activities. If she gets ill, she has the burden to
        demonstrate to <em>C&amp;co</em> that she's unable to
        exercise, by paying a company approved doctor to certify
        her condition. Moreover, the supposedly healthier diet
        required by the insurance company is a bit pricier than her
        usual diet.</p>
        <p>Still, convinced that at the end of the game the lower
        price and the exercise should make her fitter and less
        poor, she surrenders her privacy, her free time, and her
        free will to <em>C&amp;co</em>.</p>
        <section id="sec-7">
          <p><em>3.1.1 Comment.</em> The reader could think that
          many of the technologies described in this Scenario are
          impossible or too futuristic, but this is not the case.
          The system that predicts the emergence of diabetes within
          one year already exists [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
          "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]. Eichstaedt et&nbsp;al.
          [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=

          "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] were able to build a model based
          only on Twitter language predicting Artherosclerotic
          Hearth Diseases mortality with good results.</p>
          <p>Putting a “black box” to humans may seem unlawful or
          at least unethical due to the privacy concerns that this
          may rise, as we already pointed out in
          Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-4">2</a>.
          Nevertheless, the first patent related to the use of
          fitness devices in health insurances can be tracked down
          to the early 2000s [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
          data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. More recently, fitness device
          makers like e.g., Fitbit, began to sign agreements with
          insurance companies in order to provide discounted plans
          for their users. Some media already expressed their
          concerns, fearing that giving access of the wearables’
          data to the insurance companies could allow them to
          exploit such data even to deny coverage e.g. if they
          found clues of a pre-existing condition [<a class="bib"

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.2</span> Scenario 2:
            Bob's Mortgage</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Bob is a thirty three years old man. He has a full time
        permanent job, which pays well enough to allow his wife to
        be a stay-at-home mom. He is healthy, fit, and his medical
        record shows no prior episodes nor any predisposition of
        hereditary or genetic disorders. Recently, Bob entered a
        pilot project, which aims at making fitness trackers become
        mandatory for all adults. This way, the NHS wants to
        monitor the health of the citizens and, by encouraging the
        sharing of personal achievements on social media, to put
        social pressure on people in order to stay fitter. Many of
        Bob's friends entered the program as well, and all the
        group started sharing and comparing their achievements on
        social media.</p>
        <p>This puts a huge pressure on Bob. In fact, while he is a
        perfectly fit person, he is used to sleep just seven hours
        per night, while the fitness tracking program goal is of
        eight hours per night. He consulted a clinician, which
        analyzed his sleep patterns with professional instruments
        and concluded that Bob had no sleeping problems whatsoever.
        Still, Bob is unconvinced by the clinician's advice,
        because his friend easily manage to get eight hours of
        sleep, and they happily share their results on social
        media. Bob begins to stress himself, and develops
        irritability, tiredness, and attention and memory
        problems.</p>
        <p>However, since its new permanent job provides to his
        family a good income, Bob decides to buy a new house closer
        to the city center. Hence, he contacts his bank, looking
        for information about mortgages. Surprisingly, his
        financial advisor communicates him that at the moment he's
        not eligible for a mortgage, due to potential health issues
        detected by his personal fitness tracker.</p>
        <p>In fact, the pilot program he enrolled in is partially
        financed by private companies, which are happy to cover
        part of the costs of buying the fitness trackers in
        exchange of information about their customers, current or
        potential. The information provided by Bob's fitness
        tracker, both voluntarily (i.e., shared by Bob on social
        media) and involuntarily (i.e., as part of the deal between
        his bank and the NHS) reveal his sleep problems, which have
        deteriorated over time, and his now frequent anxious
        outbreaks. This can be potentially dangerous, since Bob's
        new home will be located quite far from his workplace. Bob
        drives to work every day, thus the risk of him having a
        (potentially fatal) car accident due to the lack of sleep
        is too high for the bank to lend him such a conspicuous
        amount of money.</p>
        <p>As his stress levels increase, his wife manages to get
        Bob visited again by a professional. The clinician
        diagnoses Bob with orthosomnia, a recently discovered
        illness where patients, trying to match the sleep
        requirements of their personal trackers, develop stress and
        anxiety problems because they can't manage to match their
        expectations. Much to his dismay, Bob is forcibly removed
        from the pilot program (who continues nevertheless) and put
        on mandatory psychological support.</p>
        <section id="sec-9">
          <p><em>3.2.1 Comment.</em> <em>Orthosomnia</em> is a
          psychological condition recently identified by Baron
          et&nbsp;al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
          data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>], who analyzed the behavior of
          fitness trackers users who used these devices to track
          their sleep. The authors “chose this term because the
          perfectionist quest to achieve perfect sleep is similar
          to the unhealthy preoccupation with healthy eating,
          termed orthorexia”: patients, in fact, were always
          unsatisfied with their sleep quality, just because they
          didn't meet the expectations of their fitness trackers.
          For example, a patient “felt pressure every night to
          ensure his tracker would display at least eight hours of
          sleep”, and another patient was convinced that she was
          sleeping poorly even if medical evidence (e.g.,
          polysomnogram) suggested that she had no sleep related
          problems, only because her Fitbit didn't say so. In Bob's
          case, orthosomnia is aggravated by the fact that not only
          his fitness trackers says he doesn't sleep enough, but
          also his friend share positive sleep records on social
          media, thus increasing his pressure on getting (and
          possibly sharing) good results.</p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.3</span> Scenario 3:
            Charlie's Problem</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Charlie is an eight years old child, of normal weight,
        who lives in an happy neighborhood, full of kids of the
        same age. Charlie comes from an average-income family,
        which always provided him care and affection. However, he
        doesn't have many friends: in fact, both Charlie's parents
        have a full-time job, and they had to put him in a school
        which provides afternoon lessons, more expensive than a
        usual <em>part-time</em> one. For this reason, Charlie
        usually spends a lot of time sit at his desk studying,
        attending lessons, and only during the intervals he can
        play with his schoolmates. When it is time to go home,
        Charlie's parents are too tired to make him attend other
        afternoon activities, such as a sport or a musical
        instrument lesson, making his <em>fitness/social</em> rank
        lower than expected in his neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Charlie usually has lunch at school, which provides a
        complete and balanced diet, approved by a nutritionist and
        a medical équipe.</p>
        <p>Charlie's parents’ workplaces are located in the same
        block, thus they often take the chance to spend the lunch
        time together. Since they don't have enough time –and
        sometimes they are too lazy in the evening– to bring
        homemade food, they often rely on the local <em>fast
        food</em> restaurant near their offices, where they pay via
        credit card. It is cheaper than an healthier choice but,
        they think having a lighter and balanced meal in the
        evening will compensate the high calories, salt, and fat
        intake. They don't have time to make any activity other
        than job and family. Thus, their fitness rank is quite low,
        since their unhealthy habits are constantly analyzed by the
        social rank system connected to their bank account.</p>
        <p>Charlie has been discovered with a kidney condition
        which remained silent for the majority of his life.
        Nevertheless, this year he had two episodes and the
        physician told his parents that he needs a surgery to avoid
        a kidney failure. Contrary to his parents’ expectations,
        Charlie is very low in the scheduled surgery list, due to
        his apparently unhealthy behavior. Indeed, like the rest of
        the people, every member of Charlie's family has been
        provided with an activity tracker –which is attached to the
        personal ID profile hosted on a public national website–
        able to <em>quantify</em> and <em>rank</em> the activity of
        each person. According to this device, Charlie does not
        exercise as often as he is expected, thus he is categorized
        as <em>lazy</em>, and he is suspected of not doing enough
        to maintain his health. Moreover, since these data are
        publicly visible, the other children parent's prevent their
        kids to spend time with Charlie, to avoid contamination
        from his perceived lazier attitude.</p>
        <p>The second important factor in the surgery list
        positioning was played by Charlie's parents eating habits.
        They often eat at the local fast food restaurant, and,
        since Charlie can't be tracked (he obviously does not own a
        credit card), a statistical cross-check suggests the system
        that very often children has the same eating habits of
        their parents.</p>
        <p>In the end Charlie's parents provided the proofs about
        the food, since the school signed a paper guaranteeing that
        the child had an healthier habit than his parents. In this
        way he was able to earn few position on the surgery list.
        However, people with the possibility of having an healthier
        and supposedly fitter health style are still
        <em>ranked</em> higher than him.</p>
        <section id="sec-11">
          <p><em>3.3.1 Comment.</em> This scenario further pushes
          Bauman's definition of fitness: since there is not a
          clear limit, every time the expectation can be increased
          (we are never too fit, never too thin, never too smart,
          etc). However, in a world where big data analytics and
          social network analysis allow the constant monitoring of
          citizens, there are people who may not be able to comply
          with the constant request of being “better”.</p>
          <p>For example, the Chinese government is supposedly
          developing a “social rank” in order to classify people
          and distinguish a “reliable” person from an unreliable
          one [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
          "popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. The social rank, developed in
          cooperation with private companies, is used e.g. on
          dating sites in order to boost the dating possibilities
          of good “social ranked” users, i.e. people who have a
          good credit score and online behavior.</p>

          Conclusions</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The scenarios we presented are inspired from Black Mirror
      episodes like “Shut Up and Run”, where a man blackmails
      people using information recorded from the computers of its
      oblivious victims, and “Nosedive”, where an entire society
      lives in the fear of a <em>social rating</em>, where a bad
      rating could ruin a person life. The theme of a continuous
      collection of personal, sensitive data is depicted in the
      episodes “The Entire History of You”, “Arkangel”, and
      “Crocodile”. Finally, fat-shaming is tackled the first season
      episode “Fifteen Million Merits”, where people must exercise
      in order to conquer the possibility of escaping from a
      dystopian, “Big Brother”-like world.</p>
      <p>In the world we depicted, the blackmailer from “Shut Up
      and Run” is replaced by organizations like insurance
      companies or national health care systems, which impose the
      continuous, never ending fitness paradigm to their
      customers-patients. In this way, people are forced to
      renounce to their privacy and/or of their right of being
      <em>healthy</em> without the need of being overly
      <em>fit</em>. Moreover, such organizations could favor people
      who can <em>afford</em> to buy such devices and neglect
      people who cannot, bringing to the extreme the (already grim)
      unequal world predicted by Allen and Christie [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. Finally, organizations
      could also predict our lifestyle by using our social media
      data, like e.g., sharing locations of fast food restaurant,
      pictures of healthy dinners, or text mining, building a
      <em>social score</em> akin to the one presented in
      “Nosedive”, which could affect their possibility of getting
      an insurance or a proper treatment.</p>
      <p>In order to prevent these scenarios, governments which
      want to preserve the privacy and the free choice of their
      citizens should forbid the possibility of building or using
      social and fitness profiles to discriminate patients or
      customers in all health-related markets. Scholars who work in
      the fields of social media analysis, semantic web, and so on,
      and that believe - as the authors of the present work do - in
      the value of privacy should raise the awareness of a
      responsible use of social media, fitness devices, and of all
      kind of technologies which could be used to profile people
      without their explicit consent.</p>
