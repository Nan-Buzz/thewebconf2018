          INTRODUCTION</h2>

      </header>
      <p>Link prediction can be considered today one of the classic
      areas in social network analysis research and development
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib1">1</a>,<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib14">14</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib23">23</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib24">24</a>]. The problem consists in finding links in a
      social network that have not been observed or formed yet, but
      may do so in the future, or may simply be useful to add. A
      paradigmatic application for the problem is recommending
      contacts in online social networks [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib16">16</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib17">17</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib32">32</a>], a feature most popular platforms, such as
      Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn, nowadays provide [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib13">13</a>,<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib15">15</a>].</p>
      <p>A link prediction method can be evaluated in different
      ways, depending on the specific nuances in how the problem is
      stated. If seen as a classification task, the methods can be
      evaluated in terms of the predictive accuracy by usual
      metrics such as AUC, contingency tables, etc. [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib23">23</a>]. If stated as a recommendation
      problem, information retrieval metrics can be used, such as
      precision, recall, etc. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib16">16</a>]. Yet as far as we are aware, most of the
      evaluation approaches to date, and therefore the solutions
      developed targeting them, seek to optimize microscopic
      perspectives: the number of correctly classified links (true
      positives), the accuracy or the benefit the recommendation
      brings to each target user in isolation, to be just averaged
      over the network.</p>
      <p>In this paper we contend that we may want to consider
      structural and global impact of link prediction, in addition
      to the plain accuracy and local effects, when assessing a
      link prediction algorithm. Contact recommendation
      functionalities nowadays account for an increasing fraction
      of the online social network growth. Link prediction
      therefore represents an opportunity to favor trends towards
      desirable global properties in the evolution of a network,
      beyond (and compatible with) the short-term micro level value
      to be procured by the recommended links.</p>
      <p>In order to explore this perspective, the social network
      analysis field provides a profuse array of concepts, metrics
      and analytic methods to assess the properties of the effect
      of link recommendation on a social network. We hence explore
      using such notions and measures to define new evaluation
      metrics for link prediction. Moreover, the recommender
      systems field has developed over recent years a clear
      awareness that accuracy alone is just a rather partial view
      on the value of recommendation: novelty and diversity
      perspectives can be as important –at both the macro and micro
      levels. We therefore likewise consider the adaptation of
      outcomes from that area. We find that, at more than one
      level, the global network analysis dimension of edge
      prediction links to similar principles as lay beneath the
      novelty and diversity perspectives.</p>

      <p>Incipient research has considered the effects of contact
      recommendation algorithms on global properties of the
      network. We can distinguish two main perspectives in this
      scope. The first one focuses on the measurement of the
      effects of recommender systems on the structure of networks.
      The effect on metrics such as the clustering coefficient
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib8">8</a>,<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib19">19</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib31">31</a>], the number of connected components
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#bib19">19</a>] or the degree
      distribution [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib8">8</a>] have been analyzed. The second line considers
      influencing the network growth towards some desired
      properties. In particular, Parotsidis [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib29">29</a>] seeks to minimize the expected
      path length between the target user and the rest of the
      network; and Wu et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib35">35</a>] seek to maximize the modularity of the
      network. In this paper, we aim to broaden the perspective
      undertaken in such initial research, towards a wider range of
      network metrics, and dimensions beyond accuracy, such as
      novelty and diversity.</p>

      <p>We shall use the following notation in the rest of the
      paper. We denote as <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\cal G} = {\cal
      U},E$</span></span> the graph structure of a social network,
      where <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\cal
      U}$</span></span> represents the set of people in the
      network, and <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$E \subset {\cal U}_*^2$</span></span> represents the
      relations between people, <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\cal
      U}_*^2$</span></span> being a shortcut to denote the set of
      all different user pairs. For a person <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$u \in {\cal
      U}$</span></span> we denote by<span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\;{\rm{\Gamma }}( u
      )$</span></span> the set of people to which <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$u\;$</span></span> is
      connected. In directed networks, we shall differentiate
      between the incoming and outgoing neighborhoods<span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\rm{\;}}{{\rm{\Gamma
      }}_{{\rm{in}}}}( u )$</span></span> and<span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\;{{\rm{\Gamma
      }}_{{\rm{out}}}}( u )$</span></span> respectively.</p>
      <p>The link prediction problem can be stated as identifying
      the subset of links <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\hat E \subset ( {{\cal
      U}_*^2 - E} )\;$</span></span> that are not observed but
      present in the network, or will form in the future, or would
      be useful to add –whatever the variant of the problem is.
      From a recommendation perspective, we shall denote by
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${{\rm{\hat
      \Gamma }}_{{\rm{out}}}}( u )$</span></span> the set of people
      involved in the predicted arcs going out from <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\;u$</span></span> ,
      i.e. <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">${{\rm{\hat \Gamma }}_{{\rm{out}}}}( u ) = \{ {v \in
      {\cal U}{\rm{|}}( {u,v} ) \in \hat E} \}$</span></span> . And
      we shall refer to the graph including only the recommended
      links as <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

      <p>One way to assess the effect of a prediction algorithm on
      the network is to consider the extension of the network
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\cal G}' =
      {\cal U},E'$</span></span> , with <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$E' = E \cup \hat
      E$</span></span> , by a certain subset <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\hat E$</span></span> of
      predicted links (for instance, the union of the top
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$k$</span></span> predicted outgoing links in the
      ranking for each person <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$u$</span></span> ), as
      if the party the prediction is delivered to (e.g. the users
      of an online social network) accepted all the links in
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\hat
      E$</span></span> . Hence, any network metric applied to
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">${\cal
      G}'$</span></span> can be taken as a metric on the prediction
      method. We summarize here some classical metrics we find of
      potential interest for the perspective under discussion.</p>

        <p>An effect of recommendation, inasmuch as it increases
        the network density, is a general reduction of distances in
        the augmented graph. We may hence consider the metrics that
        measure this effect in different ways. We define reciprocal
        versions of the metrics when appropriate, in such a way
        that high values “are good” (in the sense that they reflect
        a possibly desired property).</p>

        acquaintances. The dif-ferent ways to average the distances
        provides nuances in the perspective with which distance is
        accounted for. ARSL, RD and RAE range in <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$( {0,1}
        ]$</span></span> , and MPD takes values in <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$[ {0,\infty }
        ]$</span></span> . ARSL and MPD are defined in such a way
        that so-called global bridges [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib12">12</a>], if any, between previously separate
        connected components are rewarded as the ideal case,
        whereas RD and RAE just ignore such improvements and only
        consider distances within components. MPD measures in a
        quite direct way how the predicted links bring people far
        from their usual social environment, which can be seen as a
        measure of novelty from a contact recommendation
        perspective.</p>

        <p>Notions of structural diversity have been a profuse

        data-placement="top" href="#bib19">19</a>]. From the
        simplest perspective, the degree distribution can be seen
        as a primary sign of connective diversity: a very skewed
        distribution reflects a concentration of links around a few
        highly connected people, whereas in a flatter distribution
        each person gets a more distinctive social circle of her
        own. The “flatness” of the degree distribution can be
        summarized by a single number using the Gini index
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#bib11">11</a>], which we can
        reverse into the <strong>degree Gini
        complement</strong>:</p>

        neighborhoods in the extended graph <span class=

        index, in such a way high values indicate that the edges
        are evenly distributed. In directed networks it makes also
        sense to compute indegree and outdegree versions IDGC and
        ODGC.
        <p></p>
        <p>Richer notions of structural diversity have been
        studied, related to the concept of weak tie. Granovetter
        hypothesized that such links provide more novel information
        that strong ties [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib10">10</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib12">12</a>]. Measures of link strength can be defined
        based just on topological properties in the network, and
        can be related in some way or other to the sociological
        notion of weak tie [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib10">10</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib12">12</a>]. Such measures are typically related to
        notions of redundancy: a tie is weak inasmuch as it is not
        redundant to other links around it; it carries a somehow
        exclusive (and hence valuable) connection between specific
        people or regions of the network. Such measures can be
        broadly divided in two categories: global and local.</p>
        <section id="sec4Z1Z1">
          <p><em>4.1.1 Local notions.</em> Granovetter provided the
          first local notion of weak link under the name of

          any common neighbors. We find this definition is rather
          binary and restrictive, and results in a quite coarse
          metric. The so-called link embeddedness provides a finer
          and more informative metric, which measures the relative
          overlap of the neighborhoods of its endpoints [<a class=

          <p><em>4.1.2 Global notions.</em> Along with the concept
          of local bridge, Granovetter proposed a global notion of
          bridge: a unique link between connected components.
          Again, we find this definition very restrictive in common
          social networks, which typically display a giant
          connected component [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
          data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

          data-placement="top" href="#bib10">10</a>]: links between
          communities are considered weak, and links inside
          communities are considered strong. Inspired by this
          notion, we can consider different metrics that assess the
          presence of such links in the network. If communities are
          not a given, such metrics depend on a community detection
          algorithm [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

          <p>A classical measure of the presence of inter-community

        "#bib4">4</a>]. The most common novelty notion refers to
        recommending minority items in the long tail of the
        popularity distribution. A <strong>long-tail
        novelty</strong> metric can be formalized as the prior
        probability that a random person in the network was not
        acquainted to some of the recommended people to some other
        random user:</p>

        <p>From a recommendation perspective, the diversity of a
        set of predicted links refers to how different are from
        each other the people recommended at the other end of the
        links. This is commonly measured by the <strong>intra-list
        dissimilarity</strong> [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#bib4">4</a>], defined as the average pairwise distance
        between the people recommended to each target user:</p>

            \limits_{w \in {{{\rm{\hat \Gamma

            \right)}}{{\left| {{{{\rm{\hat \Gamma

        </div>where <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

        between users, and can be defined in any meaningful way
        –again, distance functions on user features tend to be
        suitably informative.
        <p></p>
        <p>The second important diversity notion in recommendation
        concerns a global perspective and has often been referred
        to as the <em>diversity of sales</em> [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#bib4">4</a>]. In our context it can be defined
        as how evenly are the recommendations distributed over all
        users. Again, the Gini index is a suitable summary metric
        to assess this aspect, which we use to define the
        <strong>prediction Gini complement</strong>:</p>

        all users are recommended equally often, and <span class=

          <p><em>5.2.2 Information retrieval perspective.</em> A
          related but different take on diversity has been
          developed in search-oriented information retrieval (IR),
          that considers returning diverse results considering the
          different possible intents or <em>aspects behind</em> an
          ambiguous search query [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
          "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#bib36">36</a>]. Although link prediction does not
          involve explicit queries, it is possible to adapt this
          perspective by matching users in the network to queries
          and documents. For instance, latent communities can be
          considered in the role of query aspects, whereby we can
          adapt all the aspect-based diversity metrics from IR.</p>
          <p>The simplest metric, <em>subtopic recall</em>, which
          we may rename as <strong>community recall</strong> in our
          context, counts and averages the ratio of communities
          covered by the people recommended to each target user

          <p></p>
          <p>A more elaborate approach to aspect-based evaluation
          is the so-called intent-aware scheme, in which one of the

          CONCLUSIONS</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Prediction accuracy seems like a rather partial
      perspective for link prediction considering the new
      dimensions and role that social networks are acquiring, both
      as a service, a communication platform and a business. From
      the perspective of an effect on network evolution, prediction
      accuracy would just target network density by correctly
      predicting as many edges as possible. We find it natural to
      consider further qualities when setting the target for link
      prediction technology, taking into account that links are not
      necessarily all equally useful. In this paper we reflect on
      such perspectives and briefly lay out some possibilities in
      this direction.</p>
      <p>We have implemented and tested the proposed metrics and,
      at the time of this writing, we are testing a wide array of
      link prediction algorithms [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib1">1</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib18">18</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib21">21</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib22">22</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib27">27</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib34">34</a>] in order to empirically observe their
      behavior in light of the proposed dimensions, and analyze how
      the metrics relate (complement, correlate, etc.) to each
      other. We are also exploring how the discussed metrics can be
      explicitly targeted, either by devising new prediction
      algorithms that take the new dimensions into account, or by a
      post-prediction optimization of the output of an initial
      accuracy-oriented prediction algorithm, taking the desired
      metric as a second objective (by greedy re-ranking,
      multi-objective optimization, etc. [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib4">4</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib20">20</a>]).</p>
      <p>While the benefit of accuracy is easy to motivate, we
      still need to understand better what the network perspectives
      discussed here imply in terms of their desirability and value
      for the people in the network, or any other concerned party
      (platform owner, network data consumers, etc.). For instance,
      shortening distances seems good for everyone: anyone can
      reach more people through fewer introductions by common
      friends [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#bib26">26</a>].
      Connecting distant people exposes them to the risk of an
      enriching experience. Enhancing the degree equality or
      promoting long-tail users helps avoid the disengagement of
      less involved people, and the saturation of hubs. Weak links
      may alleviate social bubbles [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib28">28</a>] and/or enhance the speed and diversity of
      the information flow through the network [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#bib10">10</a>,<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib37">37</a>]. Exclusive links between communities may
      bring strategic value [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#bib12">12</a>], and so forth. This is certainly domain
      dependent, but can probably be studied also at some level of
      abstraction, which we envisage as future work.</p>
