      <div class="abstract">
        <p><small>Nagpur has emerged as the topmost smart city in
        India. In just five months, Nagpur has beaten other cities
        chosen before it to get the best implementation of smart
        city plan. A recent stock-taking exercise conducted by
        urban development ministry has revealed that Nagpur, though
        chosen as a smart city in September 2016 much after 33
        smart cities in two previous rounds has achieved the best
        investment conversion ratio. India's smart city program
        hopes to revolutionize city life and improve the quality of
        life for India's urban population. In the absence of a
        zonal plan, many parts of Dehradun have witnessed haphazard
        development over the years, which has already caused much
        damage to the vision of a planned smart city. Smart City
        would require smart economy, bright people, smart
        organization, smart communication, smart engineering, smart
        transit, fresh environment and bright living. Nevertheless,
        with mass migration leading to basic problems, like water
        shortages and overcrowding, the rate at which these cities
        will be developed will be the key. Several initiatives are
        being led by the Government of India to convert 100 Cities
        into Smart Cities. Government to Actively Use PPP Route and
        Encourage FDI for Effective Implementation of Smart Cities

          INTRODUCTION</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>As the global population continues to grow at a steady
      pace, more and more people are moving to cities every day.
      Cities accommodate nearly 31% of India's current population
      and contribute 63% of GDP (Census 2011). Urban areas are
      expected to house 40% of India's population and contribute
      75% of India's GDP by 2030. This requires comprehensive
      development of physical, institutional, social and economic
      infrastructure. All are important in improving the quality of
      life and attracting people and investment, setting in motion
      a virtuous cycle of growth and development. Development of
      Smart Cities is a step in that direction.</p>
      <p>Smartness in city means smart design, smart utilities,
      smart housing, smart mobility, and smart technology. There is
      need for the cities to get smarter to manage complexity,
      increase efficiency, reduce expenses, and improve quality of
      life. Smart Cities focus on their most pressing needs and on
      the greatest opportunities to improve lives. They tap a range
      of approaches - digital and information technologies, urban
      planning best practices, public-private partnerships, and
      policy change - to make a difference. They always put people
      first.</p>
      <p>In the approach to the Smart Cities Mission, the objective
      is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and
      give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and
      sustainable environment and application of 'Smart' Solutions.
      The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the
      idea is to look at compact areas, create a replicable model,
      which will act like a lighthouse to other aspiring
      cities.</p>

          STUDY:</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The study mainly focuses an effective analysis of SWOT
      based on the smart city, to promote the sustainable
      development of urban development of the mentioned cities.</p>
      <p><strong>3. SWOT analysis of</strong> Nagpur, Allahabad and
      Dehradun</p>
      <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Dehradun</strong></p>
      <p>1. <strong>Strategic location:</strong> Dehradun is
      strategically located and has good connectivity to New Delhi
      by air, rail and road. It serves as gateway for the key
      tourist destinations of state. The floating population
      recorded for Dehradun is 20,000 people per day.</p>
      <p><strong>(Source: city development plan, 2015)</strong></p>
      <p>2. <strong>City of Schools:</strong> Dehradun is an
      important educational hub of India embraced with large number
      of leading public schools and colleges in both government and
      private sector with over 1.70 lakh students enrolled.
      Dehradun is considered as the citadel of prestigious public
      schools such as The Doon School, Welham Girls &amp; Boys
      School, Convent of Jesus &amp; Mary, Rashtriya Indian
      Military College.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Literacy rate:</strong> The average literacy
      rate is over 84%, which is much higher than the national
      average of 74%. This augments the quality of human resource
      available in the city</p>
      <p>4. <strong>Dehradun is anchor to organizations of national
      importance</strong> viz. Geological Survey of India, Wadia
      Institute of Himalayan Geology, Indian Institute of Remote
      Sensing, Forest Research Institute, Indian Military Academy
      and Headquarters of ONGC, Survey of India</p>
      <p>5. <strong>Colonial age heritage structures</strong> viz.
      Astley hall, Clock tower (hexagonal form), Jesus Mary Church,
      Forest Research Institute (FRI), IMA, Khalanga War memorial.
      Ashoka's Rock Edict (under ASI) &amp; Ashwamedh Sthal of Raja
      Sheel Barman (Under ASI).</p>
      <p><strong>Nagpur:</strong></p>
      <p>1) <strong>Strategic location</strong>- Nagpur, the
      geographical center of the country enjoys seamless road, rail
      and air connectivity to major urban centers such as Delhi,
      Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai. Riding on its
      geographical location and a robust connectivity profile,
      Nagpur has the potential to become a key logistics hub of
      central India.</p>
      <p>2) <strong>Rich in Natural Resources</strong>- The
      presence of perennial rivers such as Pench, Kanhan and Vena
      endow the Nagpur region with abundant water resources; Vena
      dam has a capacity of 23.5 million cubic meters and the total
      line storage capacity is 380 million cubic meters. Nagpur is
      also one of the greenest cities in the country. For every 10
      persons, there are 9 trees in Nagpur. Additionally,
      industrial land available in Butibori (Asia's largest
      industrial estate) &amp; other industrial areas can propel
      industrial growth with industrial land prices being only 10%
      &amp; 14% of the industrial land prices in Thane &amp; Pune
      respectively. A variety of minerals such as coal (23% of
      state's reserves), manganese (45% of state's reserves), &amp;
      limestone &amp; iron ore (76% state's reserves) are found in
      the Nagpur Metropolitan Region.</p>
      <p>3) <strong>Competence to implement PPP projects
      successfully</strong>- Nagpur is perhaps the only city in the
      country with a broad-based PPP implementation competence.
      Nagpurs’ marquee PPP success is the 24*7 water supply project
      pilot project. With the immense success of the pilot, the
      project is now being scaled up to the entire city and will be
      completed by 2019. In addition, Nagpur has also implemented
      projects such as recycling and reuse of 130 MLD wastewater,
      installation of LED street lights in place of conventional
      street lights, city bus operations and collection and
      treatment of solid waste management. The city has cleverly
      leveraged private sector efficiencies for efficient service
      delivery.</p>
      <p>4) <strong>Established medical and education hub of
      Central India</strong>- With nearly 625 hospitals, the city
      has a total bed capacity of 12,000. With 3 beds per 1,000
      population, Nagpur is a medical hub for the central India
      region. With 35 engineering colleges, 3 medical colleges
      &amp; a host of research &amp; professional education
      institutions, Nagpur has emerged as the education hub of
      central India. Reputed institutions such as VNIT, NEERI,
      IIM-Nagpur, Animal Husbandry &amp; Fisheries University &amp;
      Nagpur University are present in the city. With the upcoming
      IIIT and AIIMS, Nagpur will be able to expand on its
      reputation as an education hub &amp; also facilitate setting
      up of startups &amp; other entrepreneurial ventures.</p>
      <p>5) <strong>Vicinity of Tiger tourism hot-spots</strong>-
      There are an estimated 243 tigers and 3 Project Tiger within
      the Vidarbha region. The region also has 4 national parks
      which attracts tourists in large number (520,000 in 2009).
      Nagpur is the key access point for reaching these tourist
      locations that add to city's economic potential.</p>
      <p>6) <strong>Experience in set up and management of
      SPV</strong>- The NMC has already set up an SPV in the form
      of the Nagpur Environment Services Ltd. for implementing the
      24*7 water supply project in Nagpur. In addition, the Nagpur
      Improvement Trust is also akin to an SPV that has been
      executing urban development projects in the city's periphery.
      Thus, Nagpur has substantial experience in setting up &amp;
      management of SPVs.</p>
      <p><strong>Allahabad</strong></p>
      <p>1 <strong>Strong Historical and Cultural
      Identity</strong>: Well established pilgrimage Centre; one of
      the four sites in India hosting the Kumbh Fair every 12
      years;</p>
      <p>a) Annually 4 crore visit Allahabad; around 0.3% comprise
      foreign tourists; over last 5 years there is a 27% increase
      in tourist inflow. The Maha Kumbh Mela (fair) in 2013 itself
      hosts close to 7.5 crore visitors ( with 3.5 lac
      foreigners)</p>
      <p>b) Fairly large inventory of built heritage comprising of
      nearly 30 temples of various styles; Ananda Bhawan and other
      colonial era spaces such as Khusro Bagh; Chandrasekhar Azad
      Park and Minto Park</p>
      <p>c) River shoreline of around 40 kilometers comprising of
      both Yamuna as well as Ganga.</p>
      <p>d) Zonal cultural Centre under Ministry of Culture,
      Government of India and Prayag Sangeet Samiti promotes Indian
      music and culture</p>
      <p>2 <strong>Known Zonal Centre for Higher
      Education:</strong> A number of renowned and premier
      educational institutions of higher learning present in the
      city</p>
      <p>a) Allahabad University (central), Motilal Nehru National
      Institution of Technology, Motilal Nehru Medical College;
      Indian Institute of Information Technology, GB Pant Social
      Sciences Institute, Agricultural University and the Allahabad
      State University</p>
      <p>b) Coaching classes for competitive examinations comprise
      a major industry in the city.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Natural Resource Base of Agricultural Produce
      and Silica:</strong></p>
      <p>Has a history of glass manufacturing works and b) High
      yield of guava, amla and bananas</p>
      <p>4. <strong>Well connected Transport and
      Water</strong>:</p>
      <p>a) Rail Connectivity: Located along the rail route of New
      Delhi – Howrah</p>
      <p>b) Starting point on the proposed National Waterway no. 1
      (Allahabad and Haldia)</p>
      <p>5. <strong>Urban Services Well Developed:</strong></p>
      <p>a) Water supply exceeds National standard of 135 lpcd</p>
      <p>b) High capacity of wastewater treatment &amp; disposal
      inventory created under GAP and NGRBA schemes, present
      capacity is over 280 MLD</p>
      <p>c) Integrated solid waste management programmes
      operational for almost a decade</p>
      <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Dehradun</strong></p>
      <p>1. <strong>Less than expected level of urban
      utilities:</strong> While the DMC has been taking initiatives
      towards SWM and sanitation issues, but the identified
      municipal services are below the expected level to cater to
      ever increasing migration.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>High Population Density:</strong> The
      population density of Dehradun is 1900 sq. km. persons per
      sq. km. In 2001-2011, Dehradun had a growth rate of around
      32.48%, which is higher than the national average of 7.64%
      resulting in congestion in the city core.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Ribbon development along major transport
      corridors:</strong> All the primary radial transit routes,
      particularly Rajpur Road, Chakrata Road, Saharanpur Road, and
      Haridwar Road in the city are marked with high density
      unplanned developments. This leads to poor utilization of the
      right-of-way, increased travel times, increased air
      pollution, and reduction in the efficiency of the urban
      economy</p>
      <p>4. <strong>Inefficient Transport &amp; Parking:</strong>
      48.1 % of roads in Dehradun are change by on-street parking
      on both the sides. Weak public transport system has led to
      plying of Vikrams without permits adding to the level of
      pollution in the city. There is significant amount of
      mismanagement in terms of the route planning for the vikrams
      and city buses</p>
      <p>5. <strong>Lack of employment opportunities:</strong> Low
      workforce participation, in 2011, the workforce participation
      ratio was about 34:66. The share of main workers is 30% in
      the total workforce, 4% is shared by the marginal workers,
      and share of non- workers are 66%. Absence of enough
      employment opportunities in the service sector in line with
      the employable population of the city</p>
      <p>6. <strong>Dilapidated Heritage structures</strong>: The
      city boasts of heritage structures of colonial times, which
      are all in very bad shape due to lack of attention towards
      preserving them and unplanned growth in the city center</p>
      <p>7. <strong>Depleting green cover with negative impact on
      the weather of the city</strong>: The city located in the
      foothills of Himalayas, has been traditionally known for its
      green cover, and excellent weather conditions. The unplanned
      growth has negatively impacted the green cover of the city
      and thus the weather</p>
      <p><strong>Nagpur</strong></p>
      <p>1) <strong>Multiple planning institutions &amp; dichotomy
      in growth-</strong> Nagpur has multiple planning agencies
      which shape urban growth but in an uncoordinated manner. This
      has resulted in dichotomous urban growth with a significant
      portion of the city's population living in unplanned,
      haphazard &amp; vulnerable areas with paucity of services and
      a sub-par quality of life.</p>
      <p>2) <strong>Unplanned &amp; haphazard development</strong>-
      The eastern periphery of Nagpur is made up of a number of
      unplanned layouts inconsistent with the Development Plan
      land-use provisions. It is estimated that there are over 2450
      layouts where existing land-use is inconsistent with proposed
      land-use of the Development Plan of Nagpur. This includes
      Mauzas such as Nara, Nari, Wanjara, Wanjri, Bharatwada,
      Pardi, Watoda, Tajbagh, Dighori, Manewada &amp;
      Somalwada.</p>
      <p>3) <strong>Inequitable distribution of civic
      services</strong>- The 2450 unplanned layouts are estimated
      to house ∼30% of the city's population. Being unplanned,
      these layouts are unable to access civic services &amp;
      continue to subsist in squalor. Services such as adequate
      water supply, sanitation &amp; sewerage, public transport and
      street lighting are hardly available to this section of the
      city. This has severely affected livability parameters &amp;
      offers compromised quality of life to the residents of such
      layouts.</p>
      <p>4) <strong>Weak public transport system</strong>- Bus
      services are the only means of public transport available in
      the city which has led to an increasing number of private
      vehicles plying on the city roads. Currently, public bus
      transport caters to only 12% of the commuting population.
      Despite efforts such as route rationalization &amp;
      procurement of additional buses, the city has had limited
      success in shifting its commuting population to the public
      transport system.</p>
      <p>5) <strong>Administrative &amp; operational inefficiencies
      affecting quality of public service delivery</strong>- While
      NMC has developed more than 60 e-governance modules, reach of
      these services is limited. Further, limited convergence &amp;
      compartmental approach of departments has also affected
      overall service delivery. The use of IT/smart technology for
      operations is extremely limited at present and hence it is
      critical to scale up the use of technology to achieve
      incremental benefits of improved operations.</p>
      <p>6) <strong>Lack of employment opportunities</strong>-
      Nagpur's economic growth has not picked up pace over the
      years which has resulted in the young &amp; educated not
      finding adequate employment opportunities. An estimated
      11,000 engineers, ∼800 management graduates and ∼250 doctors
      graduate from Nagpur each year; retaining this skilled
      workforce is a challenge since local employment opportunities
      are limited.</p>
      <p><strong>Allahabad</strong></p>
      <p>1. <strong>Lack of Integrated strategy to support and
      Sustain Tourism</strong>:</p>
      <p>a) Most of the State support is ‘reactive’, i.e. responds
      to specific events and not targeted at maintaining
      tourism-based infrastructure.</p>
      <p>b) Lack of formal approach to guide visitors on the
      pilgrimage and other sites in the city</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Higher Education Centers do not foster the
      Local Economy:</strong> Most students move on to other cities
      and towns after completing education; institutions have
      limited engagement with industry.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Stagnant Manufacturing and Industry</strong>:
      a) Most large industrial units have closed down or are
      exiting the State</p>
      <p>b) MSME sector is not supported well in terms of new,
      emerging areas, viz. skill based support services</p>
      <p>c) Limited focus on knowledge based industries</p>
      <p>4. <strong>Limited Air Connectivity to the
      City:</strong></p>
      <p>Only one airline and single flight servicing Allahabad
      (from Delhi) - impacts tourism an</p>
      <p>5. <strong>Urban Form does not Encourage Compact
      Development:</strong></p>
      <p>a) Most areas show considerably lesser density than what
      is supported except organic and unplanned built-up areas;
      very few flatted systems in the city</p>
      <p>b) No provision for mixed use development in master
      plan;</p>
      <p>c) New residential schemes are heavy on ‘plots’ of land,
      and are increasing urban sprawl more than compacting;
      viability of many line services suspect on account of high
      sprawl and low density. This is because the development
      authority is not encouraging redevelopment of high density
      areas.</p>
      <p>d) ‘Own vehicle’ centered development - modal share of
      buses is 8% only; even as motorized trips have an average
      length of just under 7 km</p>
      <p>e) Only 1% of the road network have foot paths; high
      instances of on-street parking</p>
      <p>f) Limited focus on street and intersection design;
      increase in road accidents over last 3 years (844 to 1019);
      limited signages</p>
      <p>g) New rolling stock for buses has not been acquired since
      2009; most buses have reached condemnation stage</p>
      <p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Dehradun</strong></p>
      <p>1. <strong>Gateway to tourist destinations:</strong>
      Investment towards promotion &amp; development of facilities
      catering to floating population could serve as making the
      city a “Hub” for key tourist cities under Hub &amp; Spoke
      model wherein the routes to the identified cities could be
      strengthened, promoting RRTS, implementing the Mussoorie
      Dehradun Ropeway. Significant volume of tourist footfall
      could be retained for an extra day in the city by restoration
      and conservation of the heritage structures in the city and
      creating places of tourists’ interests and information within
      the city</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Infotainment hub (hospitality, vocational,
      higher education, Information &amp; Entertainment centers for
      kids and tourist):</strong> Given the high number of schools
      and educational institutions, policy incentives towards
      attracting institutions of repute would help to start a
      Dehradun center. Currently the city has only one IHM, given
      the hospitality sector growth opportunities in the city, such
      institutes could be set up. Given the high number of
      educational institutes, the convergence with GoI schemes viz.
      skill India could be undertaken through tie-ups with the
      existing institutes. The city presents the opportunity to set
      up facilities with informational, educational and
      entertainment values for the large mass of students and
      tourists</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Qualified employable workforce:</strong> About
      75% of the population in Dehradun is below the age of 45
      years. Because of high literacy rate &amp; good institutions,
      the city has good quality of employable population. This
      provides an opportunity for strengthening employment
      opportunities in line with strength of the city i.e. in
      hospitality, tourism related sectors within the city to
      provide more employment opportunities to captive human
      resources.</p>
      <p>4. <strong>Potential to develop as counter magnet city to
      NCR:</strong> Situated at around 250 Kms from Delhi and with
      over saturation of NCR due to immigration, the proposed 4/6
      laning of Delhi-Dehradun Highway, and good road, rail and air
      connectivity of Dehradun with NCR, provides potential for
      development of the city as counter magnet city to the NCR.
      NCRPB has already included Dehradun in the list of counter
      magnet cities to NCR</p>
      <p><strong>Nagpur</strong></p>
      <p>1) <strong>Potential to become a multi-modal logistics hub
      with MIHAN playing a key role</strong>- While GST will make
      Nagpur a cost-effective distribution center, its connectivity
      via rail, road and air will make it an attractive location
      for multi-modal logistics activity. The growth of MIHAN will
      also ensure creation of a diverse economic base propelling
      all round development in Nagpur.</p>
      <p>2) <strong>Potential for Transit Oriented Development
      (TOD) due to Metro Rail project</strong>- Two Metro routes of
      38 km have been planned across the city. Works for 6 kms are
      already underway. High density mixed development, through FSI
      of 4 or more, along the Metro alignment will encourage TOD in
      areas like Sitabuldi and Jail ward. Shifting the Central Jail
      will unlock prime real estate, which can be utilized for
      developing high-density retail / medical / entertainment
      zones.</p>
      <p>3) <strong>Availability of government land-</strong> A
      large number of government, industrial &amp; NMC land is
      available for development. Land along metro corridor (Jail
      land) &amp; other important locations (Wathoda, Bhandewdi)
      will be utilized for various purposes. Leveraging the
      government institutions' land bank can generate resources to
      fund infrastructure expansion.</p>
      <p>5) <strong>A host of infrastructure projects will add to
      city's economic agenda:</strong> Implementation of
      in-pipeline projects: Orange city street project, 142 acre
      International standard sport complex &amp; sports university
      complex at Watoda, 100 acre Skill Development Centre at
      Watoda, Gorewada international zoo &amp; Nagpur-Mumbai super
      communication expressway will exert much needed push to the
      local economy.</p>
      <p>6) <strong>Rejuvenation of water sources due to Nag
      Riverfront Development</strong>- The Nag Riverfront
      Development project focuses on pollution abatement as well as
      place making by developing promenades and open spaces for
      recreation. The pollution abatement DPR has received
      in-principle funding approval from the MoEF. The Nag River
      will be rejuvenated through these interventions.</p>
      <p>7) <strong>Potential to boost tourism</strong>-
      Deekshabhoomi, a much-vaunted Buddhist memorial, can be
      aggressively marketed as a tourist destination. The Gorewada
      International Zoo can add to the tourism potential of the
      city.</p>
      <p><strong>Allahabad</strong></p>
      <p>1. <strong>Organizing and Formalizing the Triveni and
      Sangam Experience:</strong></p>
      <p>a) Provision of infrastructure and other amenities in all
      over the riverfront, positioning the same as a group of
      ‘managed’ sites which improves visitor experience; including
      developing areas for new activities viz. boating;</p>
      <p>b) Development of a comprehensive and easily accessible
      information base of cultural elements, potential itinerary
      for visiting and support services that would essentially (1)
      market Allahabad's cultural and historical identity, (2)
      facilitate smooth visits and passage of tourists and pilgrims
      alike.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Positioning the other New
      Allahabad</strong></p>
      <p>a) Areas of the city, which generate economic activities
      may also be used to attract tourists and visitors; viz. Civil
      Lines, Katra as elements of ‘contemporary &amp; living
      culture’</p>
      <p>b) Certain old and run down areas offer potential to be
      resuscitated and redeveloped (urban renewal) as centres of
      mixed use supporting local economic development; Government
      lands – which are vastly underutilized.</p>
      <p>c) Option for retrofitting/ adaptive re-use of old
      premises with a Victorian character, viz. Nagar Nigam
      premises for mixed use and commercial capitalization.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Rich deposits of Silica</strong></p>
      <p>Even though the glass industry has all but closed,
      potential lies in ceramic and other such materials which now
      have advanced applications in power, aerospace &amp;
      defense.</p>
      <p>4. <strong>High Yields of Agro Produce, Particularly
      Guavas and Amla:</strong></p>
      <p>Potential for development of cooperative or privately
      owned manufacturing units for fruit based products</p>
      <p>5. <strong>Making Education Work for the
      City</strong>:</p>
      <p>a) Establishing centers for excellence, innovation hubs
      and R&amp;D centres within Allahabad University and other
      similar setups.</p>
      <p>b) Fostering start-ups, industry – academia linkages for
      laboratory testing and application development</p>
      <p>c) Improving market access and outreach of major
      university setups to improve employability</p>
      <p>6. <strong>Connectivity</strong>:</p>
      <p>a) AAI fund (Rs.300Cr.) sanctioned for Modernization of
      Airport to increase tourists’ footfalls.</p>
      <p>b) Land available for Infrastructure Development and ILS
      system being implemented for night landing.</p>
      <p>7. Urban Amenities:</p>
      <p>a) City-wide implementation and up-scaling of Hari-Bhari
      PPP initiative for Door To Door waste collection planned. The
      initiative has potential to support waste to energy
      initiative.</p>
      <p>b) Availability of funds under Urban Transport Fund,
      Employment Generation and Self- income development scheme by
      DUDA and development of ITMS plan.</p>
      <p>c) Redevelopment of unutilized and encroached “Nala's “
      (open drains); and creation of recharge ponds within the
      city</p>
      <p>d) A metro rail is proposed (feasibility study ongoing) to
      be taken up within the city</p>
      <p><strong>Threats</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Dehradun</strong></p>
      <p>1. <strong>Depleting environment resources</strong>: There
      is a decline in the urban green spaces in Dehradun city from
      22.98% of total area in 2004 to 15.13% in 2009. Additionally,
      growing environmental pollution personalized vehicles has
      adversely affected the livability in the city</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Possibility of unplanned growth along the
      Haridwar:</strong> The city has found natural expansion along
      the Haridwar road, and with the ongoing strengthening of the
      highway; there is high chance of further unplanned growth
      along the corridor</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Crime rate:</strong> The large section of
      non-working population can give rise to an increased crime
      rate in the city if not channelized productively</p>
      <p>4. <strong>Migration:</strong> There is likelihood of
      large-scale migration to the city from the nearby peri-urban
      areas and other parts of state putting strain on its
      infrastructure and creating further housing shortages.</p>
      <p><strong>Nagpur</strong></p>
      <p>1) <strong>Presence of unauthorized layouts in the
      eastern</strong> periphery - A large number of unauthorized
      layouts exist on the eastern periphery of the city abutting
      the Bhandara road. The Bhandara road is fast emerging as a
      warehousing and logistics center which will attract
      population due to employment opportunities. Abysmal quality
      of life in these unauthorized layouts can limit the growth of
      a logistics hub along the Bhandara road.</p>
      <p>2) <strong>Brain-drain phenomenon</strong>- The young
      &amp; educated are increasingly moving out of Nagpur in
      search of employment. The lack of employment opportunities
      compels the youth to migrate out of Nagpur to other centers.
      This out-migration is evidenced by the Census 2011 figures;
      the decadal growth rate declined from 27% to 19%.</p>
      <p>3) <strong>Underdevelopment in MIHAN-</strong> The
      industrial growth in Nagpur has not been dynamic enough to
      create a vibrant economy. Additionally, Multi-modal
      International Cargo Hub Airport Nagpur (MIHAN) was expected
      to fuel the economic growth of Nagpur with an estimated
      125,000 direct jobs. However, the slow growth of MIHAN has
      further accentuated the lack of employment avenues in Nagpur.
      With the political capital that Nagpur currently has, growth
      of MIHAN can be accelerated. However, if the growth in MIHAN
      continues to be slow, Nagpur will continue to witness
      out-migration which can impact the city's all-round growth
      prospects.</p>
      <p>4) 36% population lives in slums; supply of affordable
      housing limited- Despite attempts to provide extensive
      affordable housing, 36% of Nagpur still lives in slums. This
      indicates that the supply of affordable housing has not kept
      pace with the demand. Efforts under the Slum Rehabilitation
      Authority (SRA) and Housing for All should doggedly focus on
      providing good quality of life and affordable housing.</p>
      <p><strong>Allahabad:</strong></p>
      <p>1) Flooding in Ganga; encroachments within flood
      plain;</p>
      <p>2) Continuing practice of development of housing schemes
      resulting in uncontrolled urban sprawl and an imbalanced
      property market; ad-hoc changes in land use with limited land
      consolidation.</p>
      <p>3) Increasing inventory of para-transit and unorganized
      sector in transport leading to skewing of modal share and
      trip lengths; cycle based trips have an ATL of 4.3 km</p>
      <p>4) Minimal focus on affordable housing; last two years
      have seen only about 850 units produced</p>
      <p>5) Over-dependence on the existing tube-wells for water
      supply will lead to depletion of water levels.</p>

          <h2>CONCLUSION:</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Nagpur has emerged as the topmost smart city in India. In
      just five months, Nagpur has beaten other cities chosen
      before it to get the best implementation of smart city plan.
      A recent stock-taking exercise conducted by urban development
      ministry has revealed that Nagpur, though chosen as a smart
      city in September 2016 much after 33 smart cities in two
      previous rounds has achieved the best investment conversion
      ratio. India's smart city program hopes to revolutionize city
      life and improve the quality of life for India's urban
      population. In the absence of a zonal plan, many parts of
      Dehradun have witnessed haphazard development over the years,
      which has already caused much damage to the vision of a
      planned smart city. Smart City would require smart economy,
      bright people, smart organization, smart communication, smart
      engineering, smart transit, fresh environment and bright
      living. Nevertheless, with mass migration leading to basic
      problems, like water shortages and overcrowding, the rate at
      which these cities will be developed will be the key. Several
      initiatives are being led by the Government of India to
      convert 100 Cities into Smart Cities. Government to Actively
      Use PPP Route and Encourage FDI for Effective Implementation
      of Smart Cities Project in&nbsp;India. The government is
      concentrating on encouraging Public Private Partnership (PPP)
      for successful implementation of the smart city project in
      India. Financial and IT services sectors are on the priority
      list of the government to garner investments from leading
      companies such as Cisco, EMC, GE, IBM, Bajaj, etc. in coming
      years. Few of the major companies that are currently involved
      in project planning of these cities include Halcrow, Synoate,
      Knight Frank and AECOM India.&nbsp;The real challenge before
      the Government is to build inclusive smart cities for all its
      residents, regardless of whether they are rich or poor.
      Creating a smart city is not just about creating the physical
      infrastructure — roads, clean water, power, and transport. It
      is desired that public private partnerships (PPP) will
      deliver, but the mechanism appears to require a lot of
      plucking in order for it to work, a fact recognized in the
      recent Budget. The big challenge will be to create
      self-sustaining cities, which create jobs, use resources
      wisely and also train people. The idea should be to make
      cities work for the masses. India has to now take an
      important decision in the context of creating smart cities.
      It has to determine if it desires to opt for making new
      cities or upgrade existing ones.</p>
