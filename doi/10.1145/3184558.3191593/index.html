Having the CSC score available may inspire social behavior and mutual support. The system is based on three pillars: the analysis of OSNEM activity, interactions in virtual social capital market systems, and personal endorsements. In this paper we present our investigations regarding the first pillar. To obtain a dataset, we ran an experiment where 165 participants interacted on a custom social networking platform and assessed each other. Ground truth data was derived from these assessments. The dataset shows characteristics that are similar to larger OSNs. With different machine learning algorithms we investigated the hypothesis that contributive social capital can be extracted from network properties and networking activity, which were assessed with features such as the number of contributions of each participant. The prediction of contributive social capital showed an improvement over the baseline. A ranking of the participants following their predicted CSC scores showed a moderate correlation with the ranking according to the ground truth assessment. We also investigated the relative importance of the features for the analysis, and the effect of excluding inactive users to better understand network dynamics on a micro level. The selected features are also available in most other OSNEM platforms, like Facebook and Twitter. This allows a large-scale application of our investigations.</small>     </p>    </div>    <div class="CCSconcepts">     <p> <small> <span style="font-weight:bold;">CCS Concepts:</span> &#x2022;<strong> Computer systems organization </strong>&#x2192; <strong>Embedded systems;</strong> <em>Redundancy;</em> Robotics; &#x2022;<strong> Networks </strong>&#x2192; Network reliability;</small> </p>    </div>    <div class="classifications">     <div class="author">     <span style="font-weight:bold;">      <small>Keywords:</small>     </span>     <span class="keyword">      <small>Network Analysis; Social Media Analysis; Contributive Social Capital; OSNEM Platforms; Information Extraction</small>     </span>     </div>     <br/>     <div class="AcmReferenceFormat">     <p>      <small>       <span style="font-weight:bold;">ACM Reference Format:</span>       <br/>       Sebastian Schams, Jan Hauffa, and Georg Groh. 2018.

As more and more interactions take place online, some of the non-verbal cues go missing. This makes it more difficult to assess interaction partners, especially when interacting with anonymous users, whose motivations are unknown. It is a goal of current research to extract and assess user characteristics from different OSNEM platforms and thereby contribute to closing this information deficit.</p>    <p>A user property, whose extraction from online data sources is still relatively little studied, is social capital. There is a variety of definitions for social capital. Robison et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>] attribute this to the highly context-dependent nature of social capital and argue that social capital has often been defined with a specific application in mind. In general, one can differentiate between two types of social capital. The first describes the properties of social networks on a macro level. An exemplary definition in this context was given by Putnam, who describes social capital as &#x201D;features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit.&#x201D; [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>] Alternatively, one can look at social capital from the perspective of an individual (ego level) and describe their surrounding micro network. Lin, for example, describes social capital as &#x201D;a broad concept, usually focused on the values obtained by being part of a social network and thus, referred to as the sum of social resources.&#x201D; [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]</p>    <p>In this paper we focus on individual social capital. But rather than looking at the social capital a person has access to by being part of a network, we look at the social capital each user adds to their social network. This has been described by Schams and Groh [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>] as contributive social capital (CSC), which comprises of a person&#x0027;s value-add due to their competence, trustworthiness, and social responsibility. Most interactions on OSNEM can be characterized in terms of these three attributes. Knowledge and expertise are part of the competence assessment, which happens implicitly in the evaluation of many fact-based discussions and contributions. The trustworthiness aspect includes trust and reputation which guide the decision whether or not to trust the information provider. And finally, the aspect of social responsibility takes into account the willingness of a person to act socially towards others by helping or sharing information. The inclusion of trust and social responsibility are what separates the contributive social capital research from pure expert identification.</p>    <p>As a framework for the assessment of CSC, we envision a system that is based on three pillars: social network analysis, social capital market systems, and personal as well as institutional endorsements. The focus of this paper lies on the first pillar: social network and social content analysis.</p>    <p>In section <a class="sec" href="#sec-5">2</a>, previous work on social capital extraction from online data sources is reviewed. The complete CSC assessment system is described in section <a class="sec" href="#sec-10">3</a>. Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-11">4</a> describes the experiment we conducted to create a social network dataset with a ground truth assessment. This dataset is analyzed in section <a class="sec" href="#sec-16">5</a>. Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-24">6</a> provides a summary and outlook on future work.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-5">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> Related Work</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no publications encompassing the direct extraction of social capital or contributive social capital from online data sources. However, it can be argued that CSC is related to other properties, like expertise, trust, reputation, or influence. In this section we briefly review publications that investigate the extraction of these characteristics from different online data sources. A detailed overview can be found in prior work [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>].</p>    <section id="sec-6">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.1</span> Analysis of social networking platforms</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>Hassan [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>] investigated network features that might correlate with influence. He lists the number of likes and friends as features that belong to the class &#x201D;recognition&#x201D;. The class of &#x201D;activity generation&#x201D; comprises features like the number of posts, number of received comments on written posts, number of shares of the user&#x0027;s posts by others, and the number of in-links (number of times the user or their posts are referenced). The number of times a user includes outlinks (references to sources given by URLs) is listed by Hassan as the class of &#x201D;novelty&#x201D;.</p>     <p>An approach to infer and continuously update a user&#x0027;s influence was presented by Rao et al.

They used several features, like the total number of tweets, followers, and friends. Profile information and user statistics were also used. As ground truth for expertise they identified the profiles of scientists, as they can be regarded as experts of their fields. The precision of the classification was between 0.88 and 0.96. The most useful feature was the number of tweets.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-8">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.3</span> Analysis of threaded discussion boards</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>Publications about threaded discussion boards are sparse.

The Hirsch index is a popular example. It is defined as follows: &#x201D;[&#x2026;] the index h [is] defined as the number of papers with citation number &#x2265; h, as a useful index to characterize the scientific output of a researcher.&#x201D; [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>] A scientist who published many papers that are only cited once may have the same h-index as a scientist who only published one paper that was cited often. Variations of the h-index are the g-index by Egghe [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>], or the i10 index provided by Google Scholar [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>].</p>     <p>Other investigations were conducted by Kas et al.

This assessment usually takes place automatically in every-day interactions and may be informed by past experiences and the opinion of others [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>]. As a step towards increased CSC transparency, we propose a system imitating this process. As explained before, it consists of three pillars / three main sources of information: observed interactions in OSNEM, accumulation of CSC in social capital markets, and real-life expertise attested by certifications and endorsements (see figure 1). <figure id="fig1">     <img src="../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191593/images/www18companion-332-fig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 1"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span>      <span class="figure-title">The three pillars of the CSC system. This article focuses on the first pillar.</span>     </div>     </figure>    </p>    <p>The focus of this paper lies on the first pillar, the extraction of CSC from online data sources. Therefore, we give an overview of the whole system and describe the social network and content analysis and our experiment in more detail in the following section.</p>    <p>As a measure of a person&#x0027;s contributive social capital we introduce the term <strong>Contributive Social Capital Weight (</strong>     <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$CSCW^t_i$</span>     </span>     <strong>)</strong> of a person <em>i</em> in topic <em>t</em>. The first pillar of the system leverages the vast amount of data that is available from online data sources. The first step is to identify relevant data sources. Contributive social capital focuses on the value a person adds to their social network in the form of knowledge shared and help given via interactions with other network participants. Therefore, the most relevant data sources focus on interactions, rather than personal information. Five data sources that fulfill these requirements are:</p>    <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list1" label="&#x2022;">social networking platforms (like Facebook),<br/></li>     <li id="list2" label="&#x2022;">micro-blogging (like Twitter),<br/></li>     <li id="list3" label="&#x2022;">threaded discussion boards (like Quora or Reddit),<br/></li>     <li id="list4" label="&#x2022;">scientometrics,<br/></li>     <li id="list5" label="&#x2022;">and direct communication (like Email).<br/></li>    </ul>    <p>Direct communication in the form of Email or Whatsapp messages is usually private, therefore we do not consider it in this publication. The other four sources can be, to some extent, publicly accessed and investigated for CSC assessment. The interactions of each user in a platform associated with a data source can be described in terms of features. With these features and a ground truth value that reflects the user&#x0027;s CSC, one can investigate whether CSC can be extracted with machine learning algorithms. Similar systems have been used for the assessment of influence as shown by Rao et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>] The CSC value can be divided along the topics of a user&#x0027;s interest to determine topic-sensitive <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$CSCW^t_i$</span>     </span> values. Identifying these topics could, e.g., be achieved with topic modeling [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. When assigning a CSC score to a topic one has to regard that users may talk authoritatively about matters outside their area of expertise.</p>    <p>Another way to infer CSC that directly assigns topics to the <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$CSCW^t_i$</span>     </span>, is the use of a market system in which every participant has a certain amount of virtual currency that we call social capital currency (SCC). The SCC is either distributed when registering to the system or as a monthly payment similar to basic income. Market participants can transfer their currency freely. One can pay for information or services, thank others for good contributions on social media platforms, or acknowledge beneficial social behavior in general. When making a transaction, the sender specifies the topic of the recipient&#x0027;s social behavior that motivated the transaction. The recipient&#x0027;s <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$CSCW^{topic}_{recipient}$</span>     </span> increases in proportion to the received currency SCC. After person A transfers <em>&#x0394;SCC</em> to person B in topic <em>i</em>, A&#x0027;s updated <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$SCC_A^{\prime }$</span>     </span> and <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$CSCW_A^{\prime }$</span>     </span> are: <div class="table-responsive" id="Xeq1">     <div class="display-equation">      <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} SCC_A^{\prime } = SCC_A - \Delta SCC \end{equation} </span>      <br/>      <span class="equation-number">(1)</span>     </div>     </div>     <div class="table-responsive" id="Xeq2">     <div class="display-equation">      <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} CSCW_A^{i^{\prime }} = CSCW_{A}^{i} \end{equation} </span>      <br/>      <span class="equation-number">(2)</span>     </div>     </div> For the recipient B, <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$SCC_B^{\prime }$</span>     </span> and <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$CSCW_B^{\prime }$</span>     </span> change as follows: <div class="table-responsive" id="Xeq3">     <div class="display-equation">      <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} SCC_B^{\prime } = SCC_B + \Delta SCC \end{equation} </span>      <br/>      <span class="equation-number">(3)</span>     </div>     </div>     <div class="table-responsive" id="eq1">     <div class="display-equation">      <span class="tex mytex">\begin{align} CSCW_B^{i^{\prime }} = CSCW_{B}^{i} + \alpha \cdot CSCW_A^i \cdot \Delta SCC \end{align} </span>      <br/>      <span class="equation-number">(4)</span>     </div>     </div> Two terms contribute to B&#x0027;s new <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$CSCW_B^{\prime }$</span>     </span>:</p>    <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list6" label="&#x2022;"><span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$CSCW_{B}^{i}$</span>     </span> is B&#x0027;s CSCW before the transaction.<br/></li>     <li id="list7" label="&#x2022;"><span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\alpha \cdot CSCW_A^i \cdot \Delta SCC$</span>     </span> is the increase that is influenced by a factor <em>&#x03B1;</em>, A&#x0027;s <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$CSCW_A^i$</span>     </span>, and the amount of transferred capital <em>&#x0394;SCC</em>.<br/></li>    </ul>    <p>B&#x0027;s weight was included to achieve a PageRank-like effect [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] that takes the social capital of the sender into account. The term <em>&#x0394;SCC</em> assigns more weight to larger, i.e. more important, transactions. The nature of the factor <em>&#x03B1;</em> needs to be determined in future research as a compromise between avoiding inflation of CSCW and preserving the effect of small transfers.</p>    <p>The third pillar includes real-world knowledge as reflected by endorsements and certifications. Certifications are issued by institutions, companies, or governments and allow participants to replicate real-world contributive social capital inside the system. Examples for such certifications are degrees by universities or the completion of online courses. The amount by which the CSCW is increased should depend on three factors:</p>    <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list8" label="&#x2022;">amount of time required to obtain the degree,<br/></li>     <li id="list9" label="&#x2022;">skill required to obtain the degree,<br/></li>     <li id="list10" label="&#x2022;">CSCW of users with comparable endorsements (to provide a frame of reference).<br/></li>    </ul>    <p>The endorsement by others is a similar process that gives the chance to replicate real-life CSC. In this case the CSCW increase should depend on the CSCW of the endorser.</p>    <p>The extend to which this system can bring transparency in online interactions needs to be investigated in several practical experiments. In this paper we analyze the extraction from online social networking. It is important to keep in mind that such research may present a potential thread to a user&#x0027;s privacy as well as to keep in mind the ethical implications of such a system.</p>    <p>There are no publicly available datasets that have been annotated with a ground truth suitable for the encompassing analysis of CSC. Therefore, we conducted an experiment with the goal of collecting network interaction data and obtaining social capital ground truth from the participants.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-11">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">4</span> Building a Social Network Dataset</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>The experiment was conducted within the practical part of a lecture on social computing in the summer term 2017 at Technical University of Munich. Participation was voluntary but students of the course were encouraged to do so, as they would be using anonymized excerpts of the data in the exercises that accompanied the course. This was generally perceived as more interesting than analyzing artificial social networks. Of over 400 students who took the course, 242 registered to the system and for 165 we collected at least one ground truth assessment by others. The networking platform was based on Elgg<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, an open source framework for creating custom social networking platforms. Users were provided with a functionality similar to Facebook and Twitter. They could create profiles with pictures, follow one another, write posts, or comment on own or other people&#x0027;s posts. They could also &#x201D;like&#x201D; posts and comments and send private messages.</p>    <p>Students could contribute to the social networking platform during a timespan of nine weeks in the middle of the semester. During this time 244 posts, 2868 comments, 1930 following relationships, and 3651 likes were created by the 165 participants. Users were free to write about what they wanted. To encourage discussions, different conversation starters in controversial topics were given in the lecture: populism in politics, living in Munich, and healthy food and sustainability. All three topics were actively discussed by the users. The authors of this paper did not take part in the experiment and did not review or comment on any discussions in order not to influence the dynamic of the network.</p>    <p>The observed behavior was similar to what one might see on platforms like Facebook or Twitter. Some people discussed current affairs, others posted funny content, memes, and sometimes spam-like messages or advertisements (e.g., for university events that they organized).</p>    <section id="sec-12">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">4.1</span> Ground truth assessment</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>For the ground truth assessment, the students were asked to answer a questionnaire about other students in the course. They were presented with a list of all students who registered and could select as many as they felt confident to assess. There was a total number of 539 assessments for 165 students, an average of 3.3 assessments per person. Only these 165 people were considered for further analysis.</p>     <p>The questionnaire consisted of 8 questions, each associated with one of the three hypothesized contributing factors of CSC: competence, trustworthiness, and social responsibility. All assessments were made on a scale with 100 unmarked steps.</p>     <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list11" label="&#x2022;">The competence assessment should be related to the knowledge and expertise a person demonstrated in the network. Therefore, we asked for direct assessments in the three topics that were given as discussion starters during the experiment.

They elicited with an overall assessment of trust, the belief that the other person was concerned with the other&#x0027;s welfare, and finally the feeling to what extent the person is fair and honest.<br/></li>     <li id="list13" label="&#x2022;">The third part of CSC, the social responsibility, was assessed with two questions. The first asked about the environmental friendliness of the person, the second about their level of social support and engagement.<br/></li>     </ul>     <p>The eight questions provided the participants with a multi-faceted way to assess their counterpart, with the individual characteristics being easier to assess than contributive social capital directly. The full questionnaire is given in appendix <a class="sec" href="#sec-25">A</a>. A single CSC value per person was calculated by averaging over all values. This was used as ground truth for the following analysis. The mean CSC value was 64.0 with a standard deviation of 11.5, minimum value was 29.8, maximum value 94.8.

Decision tree and random forest regression also showed a moderate positive correlation (<em>&#x03C1;</em> = 0.41 and <em>&#x03C1;</em> = 0.41). The case of linear regression and neural network regression is particularly interesting. Both algorithms only showed marginal improvements in the first analysis. In the ranking they demonstrated a weak positive correlation of <em>r</em> = 0.24 for linear regression and <em>r</em> = 0.29 for the neural network. This might indicate that it is easier for algorithms to rank people according to their CSC than to predict a concrete value.</p>     </section>    </section>    <section id="sec-20">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">5.2</span> Prediction and correlation with active user subset</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>Some of the students in the dataset of 165 participants contributed very little to the social network.

These values indicate that it might be possible to predict contributive social capital from features present in social networking platforms. However, the values are merely small to moderate and might additionally be biased due to the shortcomings of the experiment, as we discussed in section <a class="sec" href="#sec-15">4.4</a>. Therefore, it is important to use caution until the findings are supported by large-scale experiments with data from existing social networking platforms. We are not aware of any similar experiments for the analysis of contributive social capital in social networks, therefore it is hard to compare the values of our results. Nevertheless, one can make several other observations:</p>     <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list19" label="&#x2022;">The best algorithms for the prediction of contributive social capital are random forest (best results for both datasets) and the neural network that performed also well on the active user network.<br/></li>     <li id="list20" label="&#x2022;">For the ranking of users according to their CSC score on the whole dataset we get the best result with decision tree and random forest regression (Pearson correlation), or linear regression with and without regularization (Spearman correlation). On the active user dataset, the best results are given by the neural network and random forest (Pearson correlation), respectively random forest and neural network (Spearman correlation).<br/></li>     <li id="list21" label="&#x2022;">It seems that a better result can be achieved by ranking the users than by predicting concrete CSC values.<br/></li>     <li id="list22" label="&#x2022;">The quality of the analysis was increased by excluding inactive users. This led to an improvement of 20.6% compared to 16.9% for the prediction task, and a Pearson correlation of 0.63 as opposed to 0.44.<br/></li>     </ul>     <p>The importance of the different features for the prediction can also be investigated. As random forest regression generally led to the best results, we chose this algorithm to discuss their relative importance. As shown in table <a class="tbl" href="#tab6">6</a>, the five most important features are the number of likes a user received on their comments, the number of comments written by a user, the number of characters used in written posts, the number of comments that a post inspired, and the number of followers a user has. These five features account for over 70% of the importance for the model (increase in prediction error when leaving out the feature [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]). Three of the features are indicators for the support a user gets from their surrounding network, namely the received likes, the inspired responses, and the number of followers. The number of comments as well as the length of the posts are signs for the involvement of a user. Other ways of participating, like following others or liking the posts or comments of other users are less important for the prediction of CSC. The number of posts and the likes received on them are on the very bottom of the list. This might be due to their relatively low number (on average 1.5 for posts and 4.3 for likes on posts per person).</p>     <div class="table-responsive" id="tab6">     <div class="table-caption">      <span class="table-number">Table 6:</span>      <span class="table-title">Relative and cumulative importance of the different features for random forest regression on the active user dataset</span>     </div>     <table class="table">      <tbody>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">        <strong>Feature</strong>        </td>        <td style="text-align:center;">        <strong>Importance</strong>        </td>        <td style="text-align:right;">        <strong>Cumulative</strong>        </td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Liked comments (passive)</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">24.9%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">24.9%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Comments</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">15.0%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">39.9%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Characters posts</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">14.2%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">54.1%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Comment responses to posts</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">11.0%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">65.1%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Followers</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">7.5%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">72.6%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Characters comments</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">5.2%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">77.7%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Liked comments (active)</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">4.9%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">82.7%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Friends</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">4.4%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">87.0%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Characters messages</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">2.9%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">89.9%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Liked posts (active)</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">2.5%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">92.4%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Messages received</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">2.3%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">94.7%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Messages sent</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">2.1%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">96.8%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Posts</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">2.1%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">98.9%</td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td style="text-align:left;">Liked posts (passive)</td>        <td style="text-align:center;">1.1%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;">100.0%</td>       </tr>      </tbody>     </table>     </div>    </section>   </section>   <section id="sec-24">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">6</span> Summary and outlook</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>In this paper we described contributive social capital and presented our vision for a system to determine it based on social networking activities, market interactions, and endorsements. Furthermore, we described an experiment to investigate whether CSC is present in social networking platforms and can be detected with machine learning.</p>    <p>The experiment led to a dataset of 165 participants with network activity and ground truth values that were assessed through questionnaires. We ran two types of analyses on the whole network and an active user subset. The first investigation was to predict CSC scores based on the network activity and compare them to a simple baseline predictor. The second was to rank people according to their predicted CSC values and correlate the result to the true ranking. There was a small improvement regarding the prediction and a moderate correlation between both lists. However, this is just a piece of evidence for the predictability of CSC in OSNEM and not a definite proof due to the limitations of the experiment.</p>    <p>To address the shortcomings of our experiment, we suggest to carry out further research in larger social networking platforms. In future work we investigate whether there is a connection between CSC and market interactions with a virtual currency.</p>   </section>  </section>  <section class="back-matter">   <Appendix>    <section id="sec-25">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h2>       <span class="section-number">A</span> Ground truth assessment questions</h2>     </div>     </header>     <p>The participants could assess the competence, trustworthiness, and social responsibility of other known users with the help of eight questions.
