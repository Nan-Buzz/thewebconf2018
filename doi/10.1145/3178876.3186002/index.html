        <p><small>The World Wide Web is a massive network of
        interlinked documents. One of the reasons the World Wide
        Web is so successful is the fact that most content is
        available free of any charge. Inspired by the success of
        the World Wide Web, the Web of Data applies the same
        strategy of interlinking to data. To this point, most of
        data in the Web of Data is also free of charge. The fact
        that the data is freely available raises the question of
        financing these services, however. As we will discuss in
        this paper, advertisement and donations cannot easily be
        applied to this new setting.</small></p>
        <p><small>To create incentives to subsidize data providers,
        we propose that sponsors should pay the providers to
        promote sponsored data. In return, sponsored data will be
        privileged over non-sponsored data. Since it is not
        possible to enforce a certain ordering on the data the user
        will receive, we propose to split up the data into
        different batches and deliver these batches with different
        delays. In this way, we can privilege sponsored data
        without withholding any non-sponsored data from the
        user.</small></p>
        <p><small>In this paper, we introduce a new concept of a
        delayed-answer auction, where sponsors can pay to
        prioritize their data. We introduce a new model which
        captures the particular situation when a user access data
        in the Web of Data. We show how the weighted
        Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism can be applied to
        our scenario and we discuss how certain parameters can
        influence the nature of our auction. With our new concept,
        we build a first step to a free yet financial sustainable
        Web of Data.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The Web of Data (WoD) is the result of applying the
      principle of interlinking documents, which fueled to growth
      of the World Wide Web, to data, which results in so called
      <em>Linked Data</em>. Like in its predecessor, the WWW, most
      content of the WoD is to date free of any charge. Allowing
      users to access Linked Data for free introduces new
      challenges when it comes to financing these services. The
      question we are answering in this paper is: <em>How can the
      WoD be free and financially sustainable at the same
      time</em>?</p>
      <p>The World Wide Web is not only the inspiration of the Web
      of Data but also serves as an example of how to finance such
      services. Hence, it is natural to think about applying the
      techniques which finance the WWW to the WoD. One of the
      biggest financial motors of the WWW is advertisement. What
      made advertisement in the WWW more efficient than in other
      medias is the fact that advertisement in the WWW is
      customized to the user. Hence, it is easier for advertisers
      to target a specific user group. This customization is mainly
      achieved either by showing an ad based on a keyword entered
      in a search page or by embedding ads which are related to a
      certain webpage's content. Unfortunately, these techniques do
      not apply that easily to the WoD. The main problem of the WoD
      with respect to advertisement is that the data provider has
      no influence on how the content is presented to the user: In
      the WWW, advertisement can be added to the presentation of
      the content at the discretion of the data provider. In the
      WoD, however, a user receives the data in a structured
      format. This structured format allows algorithms to
      automatically process the data further, if needed, and does
      not provide the means to add any additional advertisements.
      Accessing the WoD from a user's perspective is more similar
      to accessing a database than accessing a website's
      content.</p>
      <p>Donations could be an alternative to financing the WoD.
      Wikipedia is an example of a content provider in the WWW
      which is financed by donations. However, a significant part
      of the users is not aware that there is a possibility to
      donate to Wikipedia or do not know how to
      donate&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>].
      Such a lack of <em>awareness</em> for the need of donations
      will be even more pronounced in the WoD. Users in the WoD
      often access a lot of datasets at the same time. Sometimes
      these datasets are part of a federation and can be accessed
      transparently through a single accessing point. Very often, a
      user might simply not be aware of using a certain dataset let
      alone realizing that the provider requires financial support
      through donations.</p>
      <p>To remedy this situation, we propose that
      <em>sponsors</em> who are interested in promoting certain
      data will subsidize <em>all data provider which are involved
      in creating the specific solution containing the subsidized
      data</em>. A sponsor can be anybody who gains an advantage if
      certain data is distributed to as much users as possible.
      However, this means that we need a way to <em>privilege</em>
      highly sponsored over less sponsored or non-sponsored data.
      In the WWW, search engines, for example, can change the
      ordering of search results to privilege certain websites and
      order advertisements on the search result page based on the
      payments. In the WoD, the query language SPARQL [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] which is
      used to query the desired data allows a user to specify the
      ordering of the received data. Even if we disable such a
      functionality, the structured format in which the data is
      delivered easily allows a user, or the program which is
      querying on behalf the user, to reorder the received data ad
      libitum. This means that it is not possible to force a
      certain <em>ranking</em> of the received data upon the user
      within a single query answer. One alternative is to simply
      deliver only part of the available data and withhold the
      rest. Data would then be delivered or not based on the amount
      of sponsorship the data received. This would create a
      situation where different sponsors compete to be part of the
      delivered data. Whereas such a situation would create enough
      competition between sponsors to ensure a certain revenue, it
      opposes the idea that <em>all</em> data should be freely
      available. Hence, we propose a new concept where the
      requested data is <em>delayed</em> depending on how much a
      certain sponsor is willing to pay for its data being
      privileged over the data of other sponsors. Our new concept
      is aligned with the idea that all data is freely available
      but creates at the same time an incentive for sponsors to
      promote certain data. The revenue generated by our concepts
      can be used to finance the providers which are responsible
      for hosting and maintaining the data.</p>
      <p>By delaying part of the data requested by a user, we are
      harming the user's experience to a certain degree. Obviously,
      a user would prefer to get all requested data immediately
      instead of receiving the data in consecutively delayed
      batches. We discuss the user's experience in detail in
      Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-16">6.3</a>. In addition, a
      user would prefer to receive data in an unbiased way instead
      of receiving first the data which received the highest
      sponsoring. To remedy this problem, we introduce an extension
      to our model in Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-18">7</a>
      where part of the data is randomly assigned to batches.</p>
      <p>The contributions of our paper are: (1) we introduce our
      new concept of a <em>delayed-answer auction</em> where
      sponsors can pay to have sponsored data delivered quicker to
      the user, (2) we introduce a new link selection model (akin
      to click models in the WWW) which captures the probability
      that a user selects a link contained in a certain solution,
      (3) we show how the weighted VCG auction mechanism can be
      applied to our scenario and we discuss how certain parameters
      of the auction can influence the nature of our auction, and
      (4) we discuss an extension to our model where only part of
      the data delivery is influenced by the sponsors.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">2</span> Motivation</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Imagine a user who wants to make a reservation for a
      restaurant in Zurich, having a rating of at least 8.0, and
      which is offering traditional food. Such a user can use the
      query language SPARQL [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>] to express the exact needs. Compared
      to a keyword based searched in the WWW, such a <em>semantic
      search</em> is much more precise when it comes to expressing
      which data the user actually wants. Listing 1 shows how a
      SPARQL query for our example could look like.</p>
      <p><img src=
      "../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186002/images/www2018-11-img1.svg"
      class="img-responsive" alt="" longdesc="" /></p>
      <p>The user issuing the SPARQL query from Listing 1 has an
      incentive to make a reservation for a restaurant with the
      desired properties as quick and straightforward as possible.
      Meanwhile, the different restaurants have an incentive that
      the user makes the reservation at their own restaurant and
      not at the competition. Assume now that the different
      solutions for the query arrive at the user with different
      delays, e.g., the first solution will appear immediately, the
      second solution after a few seconds, the third solution even
      a few seconds later, and so on. It is not hard to imagine
      that the user would not wait an hour for all thousands of
      solutions to appear. Instead, a user would probably only wait
      a few seconds before picking one of the already available
      solutions and make the reservation. Indeed, as [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>] implied,
      users become very inpatient over time and even a delay of
      250ms can influence a user to visit a website of a close
      competitor. Similar, [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>] argue how important latency is for
      the user's experience of a website. An experiment at Amazon
      showed that a delay of 100ms resulted in sale decrease of 1%
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. Also, an
      experiment at Google showed that if the time to display
      search results is increased by 500ms, the revenue is reduced
      by 20% [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>].
      Finally, experiments at Microsoft Live Search showed that
      when the research result page is slowed down by a second, ad
      clicks per user decline by 1.5%, and even by 4.4% when the
      delay is two seconds [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>].</p>
      <p>Based on these findings, we developed a model for delaying
      solutions for SPARQL query answers where <em>sponsors</em>
      can pay money to prioritize certain solutions and delay
      others. Using this strategy of delaying part of the query
      answer, we manage to discriminate different solutions.
      Similar to a user clicking on a link in the WWW, a user (or
      program acting on behalf of a user) can decide to look up a
      certain URI contained in a solution for a query answer. A
      sponsor is motivated to pay money whenever such a URI lookup
      directs the user to some service. In our example, the offered
      service could be a reservation system for the respective
      restaurant. We will denote URIs which direct a user to some
      service as <em>service link</em>, or just <em>link</em>, to
      distinguish it from other URIs. Depending on how much a
      sponsor is willing to pay for a visited service link, a
      solution containing that link might be more or less
      prioritized. If a user looks up a service link, all the data
      provider involved in creating the specific solution will
      receive a share of the money the sponsor is paying. In
      particular, the provider offering the rankings of different
      restaurants gets paid for its service.</p>
      <p>In Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-8">4</a> we discuss
      our concept of delaying solutions in more detail and in
      Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-9">5</a> we introduce a
      formal model for our concept. Note that our model is targeted
      at query answers for which a delay influences the likelihood
      that the user will consider a certain solution. This is not
      always the case. For some queries, a user does not mind
      waiting a long time receiving an answer. Hence, it is
      important to keep in mind that our concept is specifically
      designed for situations were such delays do matter.</p>

      <p><strong>Auctions for Sponsored Search Results:</strong>
      Before Google introduced the Generalized Second Price (GSP)
      auction in 2002, first price models were used for selling ads
      on search result pages [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>]. The idea of the GSP auction is that
      each bidder submits one bid, which indicates the bidders
      value for a click. Different positions (or slots) on the
      search result page will have different click-through rates.
      Hence, the bidders value per click translates into a value
      per slot. Depending on the auctioneer, different ads might
      have different click-through rates for the same slot, adding
      an additional layer of complexity. In the simplest variation
      of the GSP auction, the first slot is given to the bidder
      declaring the highest value, the second slot to the bidder
      with the next highest value, and so on. What gives the name
      to the GSP auction is the fact that each bidder pays a price
      which equals the value of the next lowest bidder, also known
      as the <em>second price</em>.&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>]</p>
      <p>The advantage of the GSP auction over first price models
      is that the GSP auction prevents “cycling” patterns, a
      situation where prices gradually rise until a sudden drop
      occurs and the pattern starts over [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>]. Shortly after Google
      implemented the GSP auction, one of their engineers realized
      that a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>] could also be implemented
      to sell ad positions on their search results pages. The
      advantage of the VCG auction is that it is truthful, which
      means that each bidder has an incentive to report their true
      value as bid. Google refrained from replacing the GSP with
      the VCG auction because the GSP auction was already growing
      attention and there would have been additional effort
      involved, both on the side of Google and the sellers, to
      change to the VCG auction.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=

      <p>In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>],
      Aggarwal et al. propose a position-based auctions mechanism
      where bidders can impose additional constraints on the
      positions they want their ad to appear. The motivation behind
      this auction format is that a bidder might have a value if
      the ad just appears at the top of a search result page, even
      if the user does not click the ad, because the mere
      appearance of the ad increases the visibility of the
      brand.</p>
      <p>In the WoD setting, it is unclear which of these auctions
      are applicable. In section <a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-12">5.3</a> we will show how the VCG auction mechanism
      can be applied to our setting.</p>
      <p><strong>Click Models for Web Search and Sponsored Search
      Auctions:</strong> Both web search and sponsored search
      auctions need click models for estimating how likely a user
      would select a certain search result or a certain ad. Hence,
      the different models used in these two fields are often
      overlapping and can often be used in the other field.</p>
      <p>The simplest models for user clicks on advertisements is
      based on the assumption that click-through rates can be
      separated into two factors: one factor which is only
      influenced by the ad which wins the slot and one factor which
      is only influenced by the slot position itself. The result of
      this assumption, called the <em>separability assumption</em>,
      is that the click-through rate of a certain ad winning a
      certain slot can be computed by just multiplying these two
      factors, without having to consider which ads are winning all
      the other slots. In settings where the click-through rates
      are not separable, a weighted VCG mechanism may not
      apply.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=

      <p>The click model of [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>] provides one example of such
      separable factors: the influence of the slot is described as
      the probability that a user sees an ad at a specific
      position. The influence of the ad is described as the
      probability that the user clicks on the ad given that the
      user saw the ad. Note that it is assumed that those
      probabilities are independent of the ads already shown to the
      user.</p>
      <p>Aggarwal et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] introduce a Markovian user model
      where the user scans a list of ads and makes a decision
      whether to (1) click on the ad, (2) continue scanning the
      list, or (3) abort the inspections of the ads. Note that in
      this model, the probability that a user clicks on a certain
      ad does not only depend on the ad itself and the position but
      also on the ads placed in higher slots. Hence, the
      separability assumption does not hold anymore in this model.
      A consequence of this is that the GSP allocation of ads is
      not anymore the most efficient allocation [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. Similar to the model of
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>], [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] introduces
      a cascading model for search results where each document is
      either clicked or skipped. In the latter case, the user
      continues the scanning of the list of results.</p>
      <p>One drawback of the models of [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] and [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] is that it is assumed that
      a user will only continue scanning the ads/search results if
      no previous ad/search result has been clicked, yet, and
      hence, assuming that the user will click at most on one
      ad/search result during the scanning process. [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>] introduced the dependent
      click model which extends the cascading model by introducing
      conditional probabilities of a user to continue scanning the
      list of results depending on whether a click occurred on the
      current document or not and hence, allowing for multiple
      clicks within a single scanning process.</p>
      <p>In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>],
      Zhu et al. introduce their <em>General Click Model</em> which
      is a more general model for user clicks. Most existing models
      can be considered a special case of their general model and
      they showed, for example, that the models of [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>] and [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] can be modelled using
      their General Click Model.</p>
      <p>As described in Section <a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-6">2</a>, a user (or program) can visit certain service
      links, which are URIs which direct the user to some service.
      Selecting such a service link is very similar to a user
      clicking on a link in the WWW. However, despite the variety
      of click models for web search and sponsored search auctions,
      none of them captures the situation when a user selects a
      service link from a set of solutions for a SPARQL query.
      Hence, in Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-10">5.1</a> we
      introduce a new selection model which we designed especially
      for SPARQL query answers.</p>

          Auction</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In this section, we introduce our concept of a
      <em>delayed-answer auction</em>. At the core of our concept
      lies the ability of <em>sponsors</em> to pay money if a user
      follows a certain service link contained in a query solution.
      The data is accessible in form of a SPARQL endpoint. Our
      auction mechanism makes sure that solutions containing links
      with higher bids appear with a smaller delay than solutions
      containing links with lower bids. Hence, our auction
      mechanism creates a ranking of the solutions by introducing
      different delays for them.</p>
      <p>The user who poses the SPARQL query and the data providers
      which offer the data needed to answer the query define the
      context of our auction. Given this context, the sponsors are
      the participants (or bidder) in the auction. Hence, we will
      use the expressions <em>sponsor</em> and <em>bidder</em>
      interchangeably. The bidders place a <em>bid</em> on a
      specific link contained in a query solution. This bid
      indicates how much the sponsor is willing to pay if the user
      visits a certain service link. We call a service link which
      has a bid placed on it a <em>sponsored link</em>.</p>
      <p>In our concept, we make the simplifying assumption that
      each solution contains at most one sponsored link. This means
      that each solution can be associated with one sponsor and one
      bid. If nobody is bidding on a link contained in a solution
      or the solution contains no link at all, the bid is set to 0.
      We discuss the more general case when there might be multiple
      sponsored links in a single solution in the limitations in
      Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-19">8</a>. If a user visits
      a link contained in a solution for a query answer, the visit
      of the service link is registered at the auctioneer and the
      placed bid is charged to the respective bidder. The revenue
      generated by the auction is used to finance all the entities
      involved in providing the data which were needed to create
      the solutions for the query answer.</p>
      <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> illustrates the
      process of our delayed-answer auction concept. A user submits
      a query to the auction. The auction executes the query and
      generates the query answer. Parts of the query answer get
      delayed, depending on how much the sponsors bid on certain
      links contained in the solutions. Figure <a class="fig" href=
      "#fig2">2</a> illustrates how the money gets redistributed by
      the auction to the providers which were involved in creating
      the query answer. The service link which is visited directs
      the user to the auction which, in turn, redirects the user to
      the appropriate location. This redirecting mechanism is
      important to keep track of which links are visited.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>To achieve the link redirection functionality, the auction
      has to replace each occurrence of a sponsored link with a new
      link that directs the user to the auction when visited. The
      auction has to track which link replacement corresponds to
      which original link and redirect the user (or program),
      accordingly. The revenue generated by the auction is used to
      finance the provider of the data. Not only the provider
      providing the sponsored link but all providers providing any
      relevant data for the solution which contained the visited
      link gets a share of the revenue. In addition, it is possible
      to use part of the revenue to subsidize providers which were
      not so lucky and could not (or not enough) contribute to
      different sponsored links to cover the operation costs of
      their services. The exact distribution of the revenue among
      the providers is beyond the scope of this paper, however. It
      is important to note that for the auction to work properly,
      the providers and the auction need to build a closed system,
      meaning that the providers’ data are only accessible through
      the auction itself and cannot be accessed directly by the
      user. If the providers and the auction would not build a
      closed system, a user could circumvent the auction mechanism
      and directly query the provider's data without suffering from
      the delays introduced by the auction.</p>
      <p>Note that delaying certain solutions is not part of the
      standard SPARQL protocol&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. Instead, the query answer must be
      offered as a <em>stream</em> of solutions. There are various
      extensions of SPARQL which offer the possibility to return
      solutions in form of a stream&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

            Model</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Our <em>Batch Link Model</em> differs from traditional
        models for sponsored search results. In click models for
        sponsored search results an ad is shown to a user if a
        bidder bids on a certain <em>keyword</em>. This relevance
        of different ads for a specific keyword can differ quite a
        lot because (1) the keyword entered by a user can be
        ambiguous or unspecific because of the lack of any
        semantics and (2) an advertiser can decide to bid for a
        certain keyword, even if the ad is not very relevant. In a
        semantic search, the ambiguity is mostly removed and, given
        that the user, or a program acting on behalf of the user,
        formulated the query diligently enough, the lack of
        specificity as well. In addition, a bidder cannot force a
        certain service link to be part of the query answer by
        increasing the bid enough. Instead, only links which
        actually match the query are allowed to be in the query
        answer. Hence, in our model, we assume that each service
        link <em>i</em> contained in a solution for a query answer
        has the <em>same</em> probability <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$p_{{\textrm{rel}}}$</span></span> of being relevant
        for the query. The probability <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$p_{{\textrm{rel}}}$</span></span> depends on the
        query the user issued and has to be estimated by the
        auction.</p>
        <p>The model assumes that a user will select and visit only
        service links which are considered relevant for the query.
        In addition, a user will visit at most one link. The
        motivation for this assumption is that, in contrast to
        advertisement in search result pages, a SPARQL query
        returns the user exactly those links which are of interest
        for the user, due to the nature of the semantic search. The
        user can judge the relevancy of the service link by the
        information embedded in the solution which contains the
        link. This is different from a WWW search, where users
        often have to follow a link to discover whether the content
        provided by the webpage is actually relevant.</p>
        <p>If more than one service link is delivered, the user has
        to decide which of the relevant links to select. Assume
        that there are <em>n</em> different links, each having a
        probability of <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$p_{{\textrm{rel}}}$</span></span> of being relevant
        to the user. The probability that service link <em>i</em>
        is the only relevant link is:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="eq1">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation}

            <span class="equation-number">(1)</span>
          </div>
        </div>In this case, the user will visit this one link
        because it is to only one relevant.
        <p></p>
        <p>However, there might be more than one relevant link. In
        case there are two relevant service links, each relevant
        link has the same probability of being visited. Hence, the
        probability the user will select service link <em>i</em> is
        half the probability that one of the two relevant links is
        selected:</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>In total, there are (<em>n</em> − 1) cases having two
        relevant service links where one of them is link
        <em>i</em>. In general, there are <span class=

        <em>k</em> relevant service links where one of them is link

        <p>Introducing delays into the delivery of results adds an
        additional layer of complexity to our batch link model.
        Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> shows an example
        of how the probability can decrease over time. In this
        example, the first batch is delivered in slightly less than
        3 seconds and the second one after almost 7 seconds. The
        probability that the user waits until the first batch of
        solutions arrives is around 55%. The probability that the
        user waits until the second batch of solutions also arrives
        is around 25%. The probabilities <em>Δp</em> <sub>1</sub>
        and <em>Δp</em> <sub>2</sub> indicate how likely it is that
        the user stops waiting after receiving batch 1 and batch 2,
        respectively, and chooses one of the relevant links
        received. Let <em>n<sub>j</sub></em> be the number of
        solutions contained in batch <em>j</em>. We can now define
        the probability of a link inside a specific batch being
        selected:</p>

        </header>
        <p>To decide which solution should be placed in which
        batch, they have to be ranked according to the bids placed
        on the links. There are two well-known ways of ranking the
        links, either by ranking them by the bids placed on them or
        by their <em>revenue</em>, which is the probability of
        being selected times the bid. Because of our assumption
        that the different links have the same probability of being
        relevant for the user, two different links will have the
        same probability of being selected for the same position in
        the ranking. In addition, the probability of being selected
        is monotonically decreasing with respect to the position.
        This means that ranking the links by bids results in the
        same ranking as ranking them by revenue. Hence, we can just
        order the solutions by the bids they contain to achieve a
        ranking by revenue. If two links receive the exact same
        bid, the ranking among the solutions is determined
        randomly. Note that using a ranking function is not
        compatible with a user specified order of the solutions and
        hence, ORDER-BY clauses in SPARQL queries are not supported
        by our model.</p>
        <p>After the solutions are ranked according to the bids on
        the links they contain, the solutions can be assigned to
        the different batches. Let <em>n<sub>j</sub></em> the
        amount of solutions contained in batch <em>j</em>. The
        first <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub> solutions will be assigned to
        the first batch, the next <em>n</em> <sub>2</sub> solutions
        to the second batch, and so on. The parameters <em>n</em>
        <sub>1</sub>, …, <em>n<sub>m</sub></em> as well as the
        delay of the different batches have to be determined in
        advance. The size of the different batches and the delays
        determine the probability for the different service links
        of being selected.</p>

        <p>We use the weighted VCG auction [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>] to determine the prices
        the different bidders must pay for each visit by a user. We
        use this auction mechanism because it is <em>truthful</em>,
        which means that the best strategy for each bidder in this
        auction is to place a bid which equals their <em>value</em>
        for a visit by the user. The bidder's value for a visit is
        the <em>maximal</em> amount the bidder would be willing to
        pay for a user's visit. Since the auction is truthful, we
        will assume that the bidders are bidding their true value
        and we will use the two expressions <em>bid</em> and
        <em>value</em> interchangeably.</p>
        <p>The probabilities which are given by the batches, the
        delays, and the probability <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$p_{\textrm{rel}}$</span></span> are needed to
        calculate the prices the sponsors have to pay if the user
        visits a service link. The VCG price <em>π<sub>i</sub></em>
        for a link <em>i</em> is based on the “harm” the bidder
        imposes on all other bidders. This harm can be calculated
        by the difference of the revenue all other bidders would
        have if there were no bid on link <em>i</em> minus the
        revenue all other bidders have because there is a bid on
        link <em>i</em>. The revenue of bidder <em>i</em> must be
        equal to this difference.</p>

          <label>Proof.</label>
          <p>Equation <a class="eqn" href="#eq4">7</a> gives the
          general form of the weighted VCG price. The first
          observation is that <span class=
          "inline-equation"><span class=
          "tex">$p_{\textrm{sel}_{j}}^{\not\ni
          i}=p_{\textrm{sel}_{j}}$</span></span> for any link
          <em>j</em> which is positioned before link <em>i</em>, as
          their position does not change when the bid on link
          <em>i</em> is removed. For any link <em>j</em> positioned
          after link <em>i</em>, the probability <span class=
          "inline-equation"><span class=
          "tex">$p_{\textrm{sel}_{j}}^{\not\ni i}$</span></span>
          changes only if link <em>j</em> ends up in a different
          batch because of the removal of the bid on link
          <em>i</em>.</p>
          <p>There might be multiple service links which have a
          zero bid on them. Any change in the rankings among links
          without any bid yields <span class=
          "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$v_{j}\cdot
          \left(p_{\textrm{sel}_{j}}^{\not\ni
          i}-p_{\textrm{sel}_{j}}\right)=0$</span></span> because
          <em>v<sub>j</sub></em> = 0 and hence, it does not affect
          the price. Hence, without loss of generality, we can
          assume that link <em>i</em> gets the last possible
          position in the ranking when the bid is removed.</p>
          <p>If link <em>i</em> receives the last position, the
          link with the highest value in each batch between
          <em>b</em>(<em>i</em>) and <span class=
          "inline-equation"><span class=
          "tex">$b_{\textrm{max}}$</span></span> ends up in a next
          lower batch. This means that <span class=
          "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$v_{j}\cdot
          \left(p_{\textrm{sel}_{j}}^{\not\ni
          i}-p_{\textrm{sel}_{j}}\right)$</span></span> can only be
          non-zero if <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

          inside its batch <em>b</em>(<em>j</em>) and hence, the
          second value of the next higher batch. In these cases,
          the difference <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

          and <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

      <p>There are two sets of parameters we must control when
      setting up the delay auction: the batch sizes <em>n</em>
      <sub>1</sub>, …, <em>n<sub>m</sub></em> and their
      probabilities <em>Δp</em> <sub>1</sub>, …,
      <em>Δp<sub>m</sub></em> .</p>
      <p>Remember that we have a probability <em>Δp</em>
      <sub>0</sub> indicating how likely it is that the user does
      not wait for the first batch of solutions to arrive. The
      probability <em>Δp</em> <sub>0</sub> is given by the user
      model and cannot be set by the auction designer. In addition,
      we set a threshold <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$t_{\textrm{max}}$</span></span> which indicates the
      maximal amount of time we are willing to let the user wait
      until the last solution arrives. The threshold <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$t_{\textrm{max}}$</span></span> maps to a probability
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$p_{\textrm{max}}$</span></span> that the user waits
      for the last batch to arrive.</p>
      <p>Let there be <em>n</em> different links. We have three
      constraints:</p>
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq6">
        <div class="display-equation">

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="table-responsive" id="eq7">

      </div>
      <p></p>
      <p>After the probabilities <em>Δp</em> <sub>1</sub>, …,
      <em>Δp<sub>m</sub></em> are determined, the delays of the
      batches can be chosen to match the desired probabilities.</p>
      <p>Note that the parameters <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub>, …,
      <em>n<sub>m</sub></em> and <em>Δp</em> <sub>1</sub>, …,
      <em>Δp<sub>m</sub></em> cannot be decided ad hoc when the
      bids are received. If one would try to optimize the
      parameters given the bids one would render the auction
      untruthful despite the use of the weighted VCG mechanism.
      This is because before the mechanism is applied, the bidders
      could manipulate the parameters of the auction by
      manipulating their bids. Hence, the optimizations we discuss
      in this section have to be done based on what values have to
      be expected coming up in future auctions.</p>

        <p>The revenue <em>r</em> generated by our auction
        mechanism is the sum of the VCG payments of all sponsors
        involved in a specific query answer. As we showed in
        Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-12">5.3</a>, the payments
        can be calculated according to Equation <a class="eqn"
        href="#eq4">7</a>. The total revenue generated by the
        auction is:</p>

        <p>If we concentrate first on the best choice for the
        probabilities <em>Δp</em> <sub>1</sub>, …,
        <em>Δp<sub>m</sub></em> , we see that the revenue is a
        linear function with respect to those probabilities. This
        means that the revenue is maximized when one of the
        probabilities is set to 1 and all others to 0. Let
        <em>Δp<sub>max</sub></em> be the probability which
        maximizes the revenue when set to 1. If we also consider
        the constraint in Equations <a class="eqn" href=
        "#eq7">13</a> and <a class="eqn" href="#eq8">14</a>, the
        revenue is maximized when <em>Δp<sub>max</sub></em> = 1 −
        <em>Δp</em> <sub>0</sub> and <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\Delta
        p_{m}=p_{\textrm{max}}$</span></span> or, if <em>max</em> =
        <em>m</em>, <em>Δp<sub>max</sub></em> = 1 − <em>Δp</em>
        <sub>0</sub>, respectively. All other probabilities are set
        to 0. Setting <em>Δp<sub>j</sub></em> = 0 means that batch
        <em>j</em> has the same delay as the next batch <em>j</em>
        + 1 and practically, they become one batch.</p>
        <p>Optimizing the batch sizes is not as straightforward as
        optimizing the probabilities. But, since there are at most
        two batches remaining after optimizing the probabilities,
        the problem becomes easier. If <em>max</em> = <em>m</em>
        the revenue is 0, as there is only one batch and hence, the
        second value is 0. If there are two batches left we
        redefine the two remaining probabilities as <em>Δp</em>
        <sub>1</sub> and <em>Δp</em> <sub>2</sub> and denote with
        <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub> and <em>n</em> <sub>2</sub> the
        number of solutions in the two batches. We will denote the
        revenue when having only two batches as <em>r</em>

        <p>The social welfare <em>s</em> generated by our auction
        mechanism is the sum of the values of all links times the
        probability that the link is visited. Since the auction is
        truthful, we can assume that the bids equal the bidders
        actual value for being selected. Hence, the social welfare
        is given by the following formula:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="eq11">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{eqnarray} s &amp;=&amp;

            _{i=1}^{n}v_{i}\cdot \left(\sum \limits

            p_{\textrm{sel}}(N_{j})\right)

            <span class="equation-number">(17)</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>The same argument which applies to maximizing the
        revenue also applies here: the social welfare is a linear
        function with respect to those probabilities, which is
        maximized if we set <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\Delta
        p_{max}=1-\Delta p_{0}-p_{\textrm{max}}$</span></span> and
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\Delta

        <em>Δp<sub>max</sub></em> = 1 − <em>Δp</em> <sub>0</sub>,
        respectively, and all others to 0. Again, to optimize
        social welfare the auctioneer has to split the solutions
        into at most two batches. Similar to <em>r</em>
        <sup>*</sup>, we denote the social welfare when having two
        batches as <em>s</em> <sup>*</sup>:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="eq12">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{eqnarray}
            s^{*}&amp;=&amp;\left(\sum \limits
            _{i=1}^{n_{1}}v_{i}\right)\cdot \left(1-\Delta
            p_{0}-p_{\textrm{max}}\right)\cdot
            \frac{1-(1-p_{\textrm{rel}})^{n_{1}}}{n_{1}}+\nonumber
            \\ &amp;&amp;\left(\sum \limits
            _{i=1}^{n}v_{i}\right)\cdot p_{\textrm{max}}\cdot
            \frac{1-(1-p_{\textrm{rel}})^{n}}{n}
            \end{eqnarray}</span><br />
            <span class="equation-number">(18)</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>As with <em>r</em> <sup>*</sup>, <em>s</em> <sup>*</sup>
        can be maximized by iterating through all possible values
        for <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub>. There are two properties of
        the maximal value for <em>s</em> <sup>*</sup> worth noting.
        First, the parameter <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub> which
        maximizes <em>s</em> <sup>*</sup> does not maximize
        <em>r</em> <sup>*</sup> in general. This is easy to see
        when comparing Equation <a class="eqn" href="#eq10">16</a>
        with Equation <a class="eqn" href="#eq12">18</a>:
        <em>r</em> <sup>*</sup> depends on the value <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$v_{1}^{\textrm{2nd}}$</span></span> whereas
        <em>s</em> <sup>*</sup> depends on all values. Second,
        choosing <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub> = <em>n</em> does not
        maximize <em>s</em> <sup>*</sup> in general. This is
        because the more solutions are included in the first batch,
        the more likely it is that a solution having a low value
        will be chosen.</p>

            User Experience</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The user's experience is an important aspect of our
        auction we have not discussed so far. Even if the data the
        auction is offering to the user is for free, a user might
        switch to a competitor offering a similar service if the
        competitor can offer a better user experience.</p>
        <p>We have already seen that in both cases, optimizing
        revenue and optimizing social welfare, the optimal choice
        of parameters results in two batches, one delivered as fast
        as possible and the second one delivered at time
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$t_{\textrm{max}}$</span></span> . Delaying a
        potentially big chunk of the available solutions for this
        maximal delay <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$t_{\textrm{max}}$</span></span> might damp the
        user's experience, however. Of course, the user would
        prefer to receive all data in the first batch, which is
        delivered immediately. However, as we have seen in the
        previous section, delivering all data at once results in
        zero revenue and possibly suboptimal social welfare.
        Fortunately, it is possible delaying some solutions without
        impacting the user experience too much. The main argument
        is that a user will need some time to consume the solutions
        contained in a batch. If the delay of the next batch is not
        larger than the time the user needs to consume the current
        batch, the user will be able to seamlessly consume all the
        solution from the different batches.</p>
        <p>Another aspect which can damp the user's experience is
        the fact that the delivery of the data is biased in the
        sense that highly sponsored solutions are always delivered
        first. In Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-18">7</a>, we
        discuss an extension of our model which reduces this
        bias.</p>

        <p>Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a> shows the
        revenue for different choices of <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub>.
        The revenue always starts at <font style="normal">$</font>0

        <font style="normal">$</font>0 for <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub>
        = 20. This is no surprise, as in both cases all solutions
        are only assigned to a single batch and hence, the second
        price is <font style="normal">$</font>0. There are two
        remarkable observations about the revenue, however. First,
        for the Tableau distribution, the revenue stays the same
        for <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub> = 5 up to <em>n</em>
        <sub>1</sub> = 15. This happens because the second value
        stays constant within this range, as the bids are all the
        same. Second, the Dominant and Equal distributions both
        have their maximum at <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub> = 19. The
        reason for this is that the highest bid within any
        distribution does not influence the revenue.</p>

        distribution the social welfare is maximized for <em>n</em>
        <sub>1</sub> = 20, but does not change much after
        <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub> is beyond seven. The values for
        <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub> which maximize the social welfare
        for the Linear and Tableau distributions, respectively, are
        quite close to the ones which maximize their respective
        revenue. The Dominant distribution has its maximum for the
        social welfare for <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub> = 1. Increasing
        <em>n</em> <sub>1</sub> further increases the chance that a

        decreases social welfare. The Dominant distribution

          <h2><span class="section-number">7</span> Extension</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>To mitigate the bias our auction introduces by delivering
      the highest sponsored data first, we propose an extension of
      our original model. The idea of this extension is to auction
      off only part of the available positions in the batches and
      assign the rest of them randomly. The result of this
      extension is similar to what users experience when using
      search engines: Part of the results is sponsored content and
      ranked according to some bids, the other part of the results
      is unbiased and only depends on what the user is searching
      for.</p>
      <p>The first step in our extension is to designate some slots
      in each batch which should be reserved for sponsored
      solutions. We will denote with <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$n_{i}^{\textrm{spons}}$</span></span> and <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$n_{i}^{\textrm{rand}}$</span></span> how many of the
      <em>n<sub>i</sub></em> slots in batch <em>i</em> are reserved
      for sponsored solutions or are assigned randomly,
      respectively. The next step is to assign solutions to the
      random slots. We denote with <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$n^{\textrm{spons}}$</span></span> and <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$n^{\textrm{rand}}$</span></span> the total number of
      sponsored slots and random slots, respectively, and with
      <em>n</em> the total number of slots, which equals the total
      number of solutions for the query. Note that once we have
      assigned all random slots, there are <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$n-n^{\textrm{rand}}$</span></span> solutions which did
      not receive any slot, yet. These solutions are randomly
      arranged in a waiting queue, where the first link in the
      queue will be the first one to occupy a newly open random
      slot.</p>
      <p>The next step is to assign solutions to the sponsored
      slots. We start with the assignment of the <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$n_{1}^{\textrm{spons}}$</span></span> slots in the
      first batch. For this, we select the <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$n_{1}^{\textrm{spons}}$</span></span> solutions with
      the highest bid from all those solutions which are not
      already assigned to the first batch by the random assignment.
      This means that some of the solutions get upgraded to the
      first batch. An upgraded solution can be either one of the
      solutions in the waiting queue or one of the solution which
      already had a randomly assigned slot. In the latter case, the
      upgrading creates a new open position for a randomly assigned
      slot, which is assigned to first link in the waiting queue.
      This procedure is applied sequentially to the sponsored slots
      <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$n_{2}^{\textrm{spons}}$</span></span> to <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class=
      "tex">$n_{m}^{\textrm{spons}}$</span></span> . For every
      batch, we only consider those solutions which are currently
      in a higher (and later) batch or the waiting queue.</p>
      <p>Once we have the new ranking of the solutions, we can
      again calculate the weighted VCG prices according to
      Definition <a class="enc" href="#enc4">5.4</a>. Note that the
      Theorem <a class="enc" href="#enc6">5.6</a> does not anymore
      apply to this new setting.</p>
      <p>We conclude our extension with an example:</p>
      <p></p>
      <div class="example" id="enc7">
        <label>Example 7.1.</label>
        <p>Assume that there are four links with bids of
        <font style="normal">$</font>0, <font style=
        "normal">$</font>10, <font style="normal">$</font>20, and
        <font style="normal">$</font>30. The left part in Figure
        <a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a> shows a random assignment
        of the bids <font style="normal">$</font>0 and <font style=

        "normal">$</font>10 and <font style="normal">$</font>20,
        are assigned to the waiting queue. The bid <font style=
        "normal">$</font>20 takes precedence over <font style=
        "normal">$</font>10 inside the queue. The right part in
        Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a> shows the final
        assignment of the bids. The arrow labeled
        [baseline=(char.base)] shape=circle,draw,inner sep=0.75pt]
        (char) A; indicates the first step of the assignment of the
        sponsored slots: bid <font style="normal">$</font>30 gets
        to the first sponsored slot, because it is the highest bid
        of those three bids, <font style="normal">$</font>30,
        <font style="normal">$</font>20, and <font style=
        "normal">$</font>10, which are not yet in batch 1. Next

        (char) B;, the bid <font style="normal">$</font>20 gets the
        random slot previously occupied by <font style=
        "normal">$</font>30, because bid <font style=
        "normal">$</font>20 has the priority in the queue. Finally
        [baseline=(char.base)] shape=circle,draw,inner sep=0.75pt]
        (char) C;, bid <font style="normal">$</font>10 gets the
        last remaining sponsored slot because it is the highest
        (and only) bid which did not yet get a slot in batch 1 or
        2. The weighted VCG price is <font style="normal">$</font>0
        for all solutions which got a randomly assigned slot,
        eventually, because changing their bid to <font style=
        "normal">$</font>0 does not influence any other assignments
        of slots. This means that the bidders with bids
        <font style="normal">$</font>0 and <font style=
        "normal">$</font>20 do not pay if the user visits their
        link. The bidder with bid <font style="normal">$</font>10
        also gets a price of <font style="normal">$</font>0. This,
        because the bidder would have gotten in the second batch
        even with a bid of <font style="normal">$</font>0. Finally,
        the weighted VCG price for the bidder with <font style=
        "normal">$</font>30 is the value all other bidders would
        have if bid <font style="normal">$</font>30 would have been
        <font style="normal">$</font>0, minus the value all other
        bidders have for the current assignment.</p>
        <p>Assume that <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$p_{\textrm{rel}}=0.8$</span></span> , <em>Δp</em>
        <sub>1</sub> = 0.5, and <em>Δp</em> <sub>2</sub> = 0.4.
        Hence, the probabilities of being selected for the two
        first slots are 0.20096 each, and for the second two slots
        0.04096 each. If bid <font style="normal">$</font>30 would
        be zero, the first sponsored slot would be assigned to bid
        <font style="normal">$</font>20 and the first random slot
        would still belong to the bidder with the original bid
        <font style="normal">$</font>0. The second sponsored slot
        would be assigned to bid <font style="normal">$</font>10.
        The second random slot would be assigned to the bidder with
        the original bid of <font style="normal">$</font>30. The
        total value of this assignment is <font style=
        "normal">$</font>4.4288. The value of all other bidders for
        the original assignment is <font style=
        "normal">$</font>1.2288. With a probability of 0.20096 of
        being selected, the weighted VCG price for the bidder with
        bid <font style="normal">$</font>30 is <font style=
        "normal">$</font>15.92, which has to be payed if the user
        visits the link.</p>

          Conclusions</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>We introduced a new concept of a delayed-anser auction to
      finance free data in the WoD. As we have seen, the choice of
      parameters can influence the generated revenue, generated
      social welfare, and the user experience. In general, it is
      not possible to find parameters which maximizes all three of
      them. Hence, it is the choice of the auction designer to find
      a suitable trade-off between revenue, social welfare, and
      user experience. We also discussed an extension which reduces
      the bias we introduce by prioritizing solutions containing
      links with high bids.</p>
      <p>Our new auction model is not restricted to the use case of
      the WoD. It can be applied to any setting where multiple
      bidders can occupy the same slot and different slots have a
      decreasing probability of being selected. An additional
      restriction is that we assume that all solutions have the
      same relevance to the user. As we discussed, this assumption
      is reasonable in the WoD setting. In other settings, this
      assumption might not apply. In this case, the auction might
      become more complicated because the probabilities of being
      selected might not be separable anymore and hence, the
      weighted VCG auction is not applicable.</p>
      <p>One additional assumption we made is that there is only
      one sponsor per solution. While this assumption might be true
      in most cases, it is possible that a user might issue a query
      which contains multiple sponsored links per solution. In such
      situations, the bid per solution can be defined as the sum of
      the bids for each link contained in the solution. With this
      definition, we could still apply our auction model, but we
      would have to find a way to distribute the weighted VCG
      payment among the bidders which placed a bid on the same
      solution. If one decides to distribute the payments
      proportional to the bids placed on the links, the auction
      would not anymore be truthful, however.</p>
      <p>What is left for future work is the distribution of the
      generated revenue among the data providers. The revenue can
      be used to finance those providers which proved to be
      important for answering queries or subsidize those providers
      which struggle the most to keep their services running.</p>
      <p>With our concept of a delayed-answer auction, we provided
      a first sponsored auction model for the Web of Data. Whatever
      the limitations of our concept are, it represents a first
      model for a financially sustainable and free Web of Data.</p>
