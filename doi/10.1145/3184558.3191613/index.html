        MiningMind Inc. has developed a technology that merges a

        after all, and explore the impact that such a technology

          <h2><span class="section-number">1</span> What would you
          be prepared to do for a free Apple Watch?</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>Everything has a price. Even us. Even you. And when it
      appears that something or someone doesn't have a price, well,
      then it could be that you are the price. For instance, what
      would you be willing to do to get the latest model of an
      Apple Watch (or of an iPhone or of a Samsung Galaxy, etc.)
      for free? What is your price?</p>
      <p>The lure of easy money is intrinsic in human nature. Since
      the dawn of time, human beings have kept inventing novel
      methods to get rich, legally or illegally, sometimes coming
      to a compromise even with their own principles, sometimes
      compromising themselves.</p>
      <p>The widespread of the Internet and the progress of web
      technologies have only increased the number of ways to make
      money easily. One of the most recent examples is provided by
      the <em>fake news and clickbait</em> phenomenon. Fake news
      are false stories that at first glance might appear to be
      real news, spread on the Internet or using other media,
      usually used to stoke the clickbait, which is an eye-catching
      link on a website that encourages people to read on.</p>
      <p>The purpose of fake news is propaganda or profit, and
      sometimes both at the same time. As a timely example of the
      former, consider the on-going investigation on the influence
      and interference of the Russian government in the 2016 United
      States elections. For the latter, observe that once an
      internaut has clicked on a catchy title and opened the fake
      news page, the owner of the website will earn a small amount
      of money based on the advertisement on that page. This means
      that, as the number of views increases, the gain of the
      website's owner will also increase.</p>
      <p>In the last couple of years, a large amount of websites
      have been created that have the sole purpose of deriving
      profit from the views thanks to the advertisement system even
      if this means exploiting and, in some cases, ridiculing and
      mocking human emotions&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. For instance, consider what happened
      in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in London in 2017
      during which 6 people were killed and 50 were
      injured&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. One of the pictures that became
      viral, and fueled the anger and hatred of the net, is that of
      a woman wearing a hijab quite nonchalantly walking past
      victims on Westminster Bridge while talking on phone. As
      later clarified by the photographer who took the picture, the
      woman had actually tried to help and in fact she released a
      statement soon after the attack to explain that: “What the
      image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses
      to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be
      of any help, even though enough people were at the scene
      tending to the victims. I then decided to call my family to
      say that I was fine and was making my way home from work,
      assisting a lady along the way by helping her get to Waterloo
      station.” Another fake news story that was shared millions of
      times is the report that the hurricane Irma that devastated
      the Americas reached the category-six storm... ignoring the
      fact that category-six hurricanes actually don't exist.</p>
      <p>In order to maximize customer visits, the news relate to
      hot and trending topics, and use titles that appeal to
      feelings such as anger, frustration or morbid curiosity.
      Moreover, the authors of fake news take advantage of social
      media to spread the news and capture new viewers. Actually,
      also social media make easy money just because we provide our
      information, along with our permission to use it, when we
      accept their conditions (often without reading these
      conditions at all). In a sense we, or to be more specific our
      information, have become the currency for Facebook,
      Instagram, and the like. This is, of course, because human
      nature can be exploited easily: we tend to publish personal
      information without thinking about the consequences, we click
      on news that we believe to be true and we share them, fueling
      the online advertising market. Unfortunately, technology
      isn't yet able to help in this case: ad blockers and
      anti-tracking have been successfully applied to mitigate the
      nuisance of online advertisement, thereby lessening the gain
      of the owners of fake-news websites and thus disincentivizing
      the creation of such sites, but work is still ongoing on
      developing tools that can efficiently detect and block
      fake-news&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>].</p>
      <p>However, a new approach has been recently adopted by
      website owners to increase their earnings.&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. This
      consists of a technology based on JavaScript but, taking
      advantage of hot and trending ideas such as blockchain and
      cryptocurrencies, could be seen as a direct consequence for
      allaying the successes of ad-blockers in blocking classical
      ads&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0031">31</a>]. More
      specifically, some websites have adopted a new method called
      <em>cryptojacking</em>&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>], which is the hidden use of a
      computing device to mine cryptocurrency. This recent
      phenomenon started with some Torrent search engine
      websites&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>], but subsequently several
      cryptojacking engines were found on different streaming
      websites&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>] and even in some adverts on the
      popular YouTube platform&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>]. This seems to be just the tip of
      the iceberg: cryptojacking has recently been used as a vector
      for wide-spread cyber-attacks (e.g., [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]) and thousands of
      websites have been hacked with the goal of injecting
      cryptojacking engines.</p>
      <p>Although (sometimes) cryptojacking may appear to be a
      nuisance and a burden for the internauts, its use has been
      willingly accepted in some cases, especially in situations in
      which the advantages the users can get overweigh the
      imposition. All of this, to make “life” easier, better and,
      mainly, free.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of this section, we asked what you would
      be willing to do to get an Apple Watch for free. A question
      like this has been used by Vitality, a company that sells
      health and life insurances, in order to reward its
      customers&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>]. Vitality has launched the
      <em>Vitality Active Rewards</em> program that aims to promote
      physical activity and better health for their customers, who
      can earn Vitality points by reaching some activity goals
      thanks to the tracking of their activities using a wearable
      device (e.g., an Apple Watch). The points are used on a
      monthly bases to discount the price of the wearable provided
      by Vitality. Hence, particularly engaged customers could
      actually earn their Apple Watch series 3 for free.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">2</span> A reward
          system</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>This kind of marketing idea is the base of what is
      typically called a <em>reward system</em>, where a customer
      has the chance to obtain a benefit providing in return a
      “dual” profit to those who provided the benefit. In the
      Vitality example, customers who keep fit will likely cost
      less to the insurance company (e.g., in terms of health-care
      costs) so that the company can reward those customers with a
      monthly discount for the watch. This is, in a sense, a
      technological equivalent of the discounts offered by some
      health-insurance companies to customers who verifiably quit
      smoking.</p>
      <p>Different kinds of reward systems exist, ranging, for
      instance, from more old-fashioned kinds such as companies
      distributing merit awards to the employees who achieve high
      productivity standards&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], to mobile applications that ask
      users to scan the bar code of some products in a shopping
      mall in order to be rewarded with points that they can spend
      to claim prizes, e.g., [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. Also the aforementioned streaming
      service can be seen as a reward system where the user has the
      chance to access a streaming platform but paying a price
      through advertisements or CPU resources.</p>
      <p>Reward can take also other less tangible forms, such as
      those that have been dramatized in the movie “Nerve” and in
      several Black Mirror episodes (most notably, “Nosedive”
      S03E01).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>],
      a 2016 movie directed by Henry Joost from a screenplay
      written by Jessica Sharzer based on the novel by Jeanne Ryan,
      intertwines profit with <em>popularity</em>. This is just the
      logical consequence of what is already happening: today, to
      be extremely popular in a social network means to have the
      chance to make money and new “professional figures” have
      emerged that are using popularity for their business (e.g.,
      youtuber, influencer). Nerve depicts a society where a famous
      virtual reality game is based on the idea of “Truth of Dare”.
      Add a pinch of social media with popularity and economic gain
      and we have the perfect reward system of our days. The Nerve
      application is a further step forward for this concept
      because the system dares the players to accomplish some
      challenges, rewarding them with amounts of money based on the
      difficulty of the challenge. So, the human is put on the
      front line much more than in other scenarios.</p>
      <p>Black Mirror's episode <em>Nosedive</em> (S03E01) depicts
      how social appearances become valuable: the number of likes
      received increases not only the sense of fulfillment and
      accomplishment of the individuals but also their recognition
      by the whole society, and thus their chance of climbing the
      social ladder.</p>
      <p>In both Nerve and Nosedive, as well as in other Black
      Mirror episodes such as <em>Hated in the Nation</em> (S03E06)
      and the special <em>White Christmas</em>, humans are always
      online. Smartphones are the first mobile devices that allowed
      us to connect to the Internet in a wide-raging and
      uninterrupted way, but the trend is to invent new
      technologies that allow us to be connected even without a
      smartphone&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. The idea underlying the
      <em>Internet of Things</em> is based on this and we actually
      are one of those “things”. However, it is not hard to imagine
      a future in which we will no longer need to bring with us a
      smartphone or a wearable like a smartwatch or a
      smartband.</p>
      <p>Several studies have been published on brain-computer
      interaction&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>] and there are start-ups that are
      developing interfaces to connect the human brain directly to
      a computer&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>], but it is not science fiction to
      imagine that soon we won't even need such interfaces as we
      will be directly connected to the Internet. In fact, some
      preliminary work has already been carried out&nbsp;[<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>].</p>
      <p>Our brain will be connected. Always connected. Our brain
      will be always able to retrieve data from the network and
      process it. This means that our brain will have a direct
      channel to the Internet, so why not imagine traffic going in
      both ways? Why not, even without a full understanding of our
      brain, try to find a way to use part of it as a CPU, the same
      CPU we have in our laptops? This may be the business idea of
      a new company that we have called <em>MiningMind
      Inc</em>.</p>

      <p>Consider the following plot set-up for a possible future
      episode of Black Mirror. MiningMind Inc. has developed the
      <em>MiningMind</em> technology that promises to revolutionize
      how people make money. A promise that will revolutionize the
      world. Here is MiningMind's first commercial:</p>
      <p>Unhappy with your salary?Are you underpaid?With our
      patented and safe cryptojacking technology you will fully

      anytime, anywhere. <em>MiningMind</em>Get the most out of
      your brain.</p>
      <p>The premise for this plot is that soon we might have the
      technology to merge a reward system with a cryptojacking
      engine that uses the human brain to mine cryptocurrency
      (e.g., assuming that blockchain and cryptocurrences have been
      legalized and regulated, and MiningMind Inc. have developed
      their own e-currency) or to carry out some other mining
      activity. Part of our brain will be committed to
      cryptographic calculations (mining) leaving the remaining
      part untouched for everyday operations, i.e., for our brain's
      normal daily activity.</p>

      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>]. Let's
      however accept this as a given and let us instead reason
      about some of the implications that this might have on our
      lives and our society.</p>
      <p>The first major implication is on security and privacy.
      MiningMind represents a future in which our brain is
      permanently and directly connected to the net, and is thus
      exposed to all the risks that until now pertained only to
      computers.</p>
      <p>Some scholars have been investigating how viruses could
      infect human implants such as pacemakers (e.g.,
      &nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]),
      but why not, more generally, imagine a virus that is both
      technological and biological? We will need to devise novel
      security methodologies and technologies to protect from
      attackers our brains, all the information contained therein
      and the control of our bodies. This could be achieved by some
      mutation of strategies such as sandboxing or layering,
      allowing MiningMind access only to a specific and
      Chinese-walled part of our brain, thereby ensuring the
      security and privacy of the information contained in the
      other parts of the brain. Advances in neurological science
      could possibly enable this, along with the ability of
      harnessing parts of our brain that are less active or
      underused.<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id=
      "foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
      <p>We should also take into account consequences to our
      health that could result from the abuse of the MiningMind
      technology. The brain could be stressed by the high
      computation activity, or we could see the emergence of new
      diseases related to an unexpected use or an overuse of our
      brain. In order to boost the performance of the brain, and
      thus increase the profit, novel synthetic drugs could be
      developed without going through traditional safe methods (as
      in&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]).</p>
      <p>More generally, everyday life could also be at risk.
      Recently, particular care has been devoted to identifying
      distractions (such as texting or smoking) that can have a
      negative influence on potentially dangerous tasks like
      driving. In fact, many countries have banned the use of
      smartphones while driving and some have also banned smoking
      (and not only for health reasons). MiningMind could worsen
      this. Human beings normally make mistakes because they are
      clumsy or because they are distracted. MiningMind users will
      literally have part of their “head in the cloud” and might
      thus pay little attention to what is happening around them,
      increasing the risk of errors due to a lack of focus on other
      activities.</p>
      <p>Social relations would be jeopardized too. We are already
      addicted to smartphones&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]: we spend large parts of our time
      checking emails, interacting on social networks, messaging,
      playing games, listening to music and watching videos. There
      would be little or no harm if these operations were carried
      out when we are on our own. Unfortunately, many abuse this
      technology even in the presence of other people, when engaged
      in conversation, at the dinner table, at business meetings,
      etc. If the MiningMind scenario becomes real, this problem
      will be enlarged as people will have even more reasons to
      spend time “online” instead of focusing on the here and now.
      Why not silently fade out of a boring business meeting to
      instead make some money by having your mind mined? Similarly,
      how will we be able to notice whether somebody is using the
      MiningMind technology in our presence, maybe while they are
      conversing or arguing with us (or pretending to be doing so,
      thus prompting our question “Are you listening to me?”).</p>
      <p>In addition to new technologies to protect us, new
      regulations will be needed as well, e.g., limiting the
      percentage of our brain that may be allocated for the
      cryptojacking engine. 10%? 20%? 40%? What number could be a
      good compromise? Honestly, it is difficult to say. What we
      know is that novel technologies will bring along novel ways
      of interacting with the cyberspace. We are, of course, not
      the first to observe this as there are plenty of books,
      movies and TV shows that depict situations in which our brain
      may connect directly to the net, and portray the
      opportunities offered but also the associated risks, dangers
      and threats. MiningMind is another such example, leveraging
      on one of the hottest topics in technology: blockchain,
      distributed ledgers and the mining of cryptocurrencies. We
      believe that it might indeed be an interesting plot for a
      future episode of Black Mirror.</p>
      <p>We wish to conclude this short paper on a positive note as
      we are after all fans not only of Black Mirror but also of
      technology. MiningMind could have a positive repercussion on
      the educational system. It is well known that GPUs are better
      than CPUs to mine cryptocurrencies, and the same analogy
      could apply to the brain: some brains are better than others
      to mine. People might thus want to train their brain in order
      to improve it and make it more suitable for the MiningMind
      technology and thus obtain more profit. Researchers could
      propose new techniques to train a brain to carry out
      cryptographic calculations, and schools and universities
      might want to create courses aimed at dealing with these
      novel technologies. So, after all, MiningMind might make you
      not just richer but also smarter.</p>
