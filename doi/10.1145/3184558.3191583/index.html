        <p><small>Studying large, widely spread Twitter data has
        laid the foundation for many novel applications from
        predicting natural disasters and epidemics to understanding
        urban dynamics. Recent studies have focused on exploring
        people's emotional response to their urban environment,
        e.g., green spaces versus built up areas, through analysing
        the sentiment of tweets within that area. Since green
        spaces have the capacity to improve citizen's well-being,
        we developed a system that is capable of recommending green
        spaces to users. Our system is unique in the sense that the
        recommendations are tailored with regard to users’
        preferred activity as well as the degree of positive
        sentiments in each green space. We show that the incoming
        flow of tweets can be used to refine the recommendations
        over time. Furthermore, We implemented a web-based,
        user-friendly interface to solicit user inputs and display
        recommendation results.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>

      </header>
      <p>Green spaces in urban areas bring positive effects to
      citizens both mentally and physically&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. This positive effect can
      be associated with a variety of activities that people can do
      in green spaces. Online reviews and ratings as well as
      comments in social media on these green spaces can be
      utilised as a reference for people to choose which space they
      would prefer to go to. However, users may wish to search for
      the parks that are suitable for a specific type of activity,
      while these reviews and ratings contain no or little
      information about that specific activity.</p>
      <p>The growth in the field of recommender systems (RS) has
      enabled people to receive personalised suggestions and
      services. There are various types of RS, such as
      collaborative filtering based RS, knowledge based RS and
      context-aware RS&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. These techniques can provide
      recommendations using information such as users’ ratings,
      items’ features or the contextual information. Recently,
      there has been an increasing trend to use Twitter data to
      provide location recommendations since tweets have the unique
      property capturing time, location and textual
      information&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>].</p>
      <p>The research in this area has mainly focused on either
      analysing the sentiments with regard to a certain
      location&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] or detecting the most popular topics
      related to a given location&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>]. However, a purely
      sentiment-aware system is not capable of tailoring the
      recommendations based on users’ preferences, especially with
      regard to green spaces that have the capacity to offer a
      variety of activities (as opposed to a restaurant for
      instance). An activity-aware recommender system on the other
      hand may fail to detect the underlying sentiment around a
      location. Imagine a user is looking for green spaces that
      have ”running” as one of their most prevalent topics. There
      might be a certain green space that is actually unpopular for
      running, e.g., many users have complained about the large
      number of potholes on the running track of that park, but the
      system would recommend it due to the large amount of running
      related tweets.</p>
      <p>To address this issue, we build a novel system that
      provides highly tailored suggestions of green spaces based on
      users’ preferred activities, e.g. workout, relaxing or
      socializing as well as the general sentiment around green
      spaces. It is worth noting that these three groups of
      activities were selected based on the popular facilities that
      are available in green spaces. Our system analyses geo-tagged
      tweets within green spaces to learn whether or not they refer
      to our pre-specified set of activities and determines the
      <em>popularity</em> of the green spaces with respect to those
      activities. We also use natural language processing
      techniques to determine the sentiment of the labelled tweets
      at each location. To this end, we use the NRC Word-Emotion
      Association Lexicon dictionary to map the tweet content to
      different emotions. The frequency of words in each group is
      later used to compute the <em>polarity</em>, i.e., the extent
      of positive sentiments, of the tweets.</p>
      <p>Our system is capable of dynamically updating the
      recommendations based on the incoming tweet stream. It also
      provides users with a fine-grained searching capability as
      well as an interactive, easy-to-use interface.</p>

          20 topics in the urban area of London, such as
          ”Photography and Tourism” and ”Sport and Games”. However,
          the tweets have a word limitation of 140 characters,

          Overview</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>The system is a web-based application, which consists of a
      back-end server and a front-end user interface. The back-end
      server is responsible for crawling tweets, data
      pre-processing, classifying tweets into different activities
      and analysing their sentiment. The front-end component is
      utilised for interaction with users, handling users’
      requests, communication with the back-end server and
      presenting the recommendation results.</p>
      <p>Back-end server and front-end user interface are
      de-coupled, which enables the system to update or optimise
      its recommendation algorithms without affecting the front-end
      part of the system. This is important since the
      recommendations can potentially change over time, e.g., due
      to the change of season, or occasional events.</p>

        <p>Our dataset is composed of 210,000 geo-tagged tweets
        within 159 parks within the city centre from July 2014 to
        September 2017. In addition, the boundary of the parks was
        extended by 100 meters to account for GPS noise. A thorough
        cleaning of tweets was required to ensure the quality of
        lebeling and sentiment analysis, however, the detail of our
        pre-processing is not discussed for brevity.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The purpose of our back-end component is to provide the
        recommendation based on popularity and polarity of each
        park. Tourists may be more likely to choose those green
        spaces which are popular while citizens may prefer green
        spaces that can help to keep positive moods. Therefore,
        these two aspects are both taken into consideration for
        recommending green spaces.</p>
        <section id="sec-14">
          <p><em>2.2.1 Popularity.</em> The popularity of an
          activity is measured by the number of occurrences of
          tweets related to that activity over the total number of
          tweets in a park. The key problem of popularity is how to
          filter tweets with a specific topic. In this section, we
          discuss the method and process of filtering relevant
          tweets.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sec-15">
          <p><em>Topic Modeling.</em> We address the task of
          filtering specific topical tweets as a text
          categorization problem. One simple way to achieve that is
          by using keyword searching, which is suitable for an
          activity like ”BBQ” or ”picnic”. Nevertheless, due to the
          coexistence of many possible meanings for a word in
          English (polysemy), this is not a suitable solution for a
          keyword like ”run”. For example, ”How many Carradines are
          there left? Will we ever run out of them?”, which
          contains the word ”run”, however it is not related to
          workout.</p>
          <p>Another widely used unsupervised approach is Latent
          Dirichlet Allocation(LDA)&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
          data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
          data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>]. LDA is
          a topic model which is capable of demonstrating the
          topics in documents in terms of probability models. The
          advantage of using LDA is that it does not require
          manually constructed training data. However, LDA is not
          efficient in handling fine-grained topic problems.
          Moreover, the problem of polysemy of ”run” and ”walk”
          might not be solved without supervision.</p>
          <p>As a result, we adopted a supervised method to infer
          topics of tweets. Similar to&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
          data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
          data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>], we
          used linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Text
          Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to retrieve
          our topics. However, as a supervised learning method,
          there is the requirement of assigning the tweets to their
          ground-truth labels. To this end, we manually labelled a
          small sample of our dataset denoted as
          <em>T<sub>M</sub></em> (around 1% of the data).</p>
          <p><img src=
          "../../../data/deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191583/images/www18companion-322-img1.svg"
          class="img-responsive" alt="" longdesc="" /> We use
          hashtags to semi-automatically label the training data
          (ActivityLabeling function in Algorithm&nbsp;1). Twitter
          allows users to use hashtags to classify their posts. For

          efficiently update the recommendations based on the
          incoming tweet stream, we modeled the labeling process as
          shown in Algorithm&nbsp;1 . The Training procedure uses
          the previously labeled tweets as well as the new incoming
          tweets with hashtags to label the new unlabeled tweets.
          This process saves the time of manually labeling tweets
          and is essential since the popularity of green spaces
          changes over time, e.g., following a seasonal trend
          (Fig&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>).

          <p><em>2.2.2 Polarity.</em> Polarity in this work is an
          important aspect that measures the sentiments of users

          tweets to determine the sentiment. The authors

      <p>This paper proposes a novel recommendation system for
      green spaces, which considers both the sentiment and user's
      preferred activity. This system identifies the activities in
      tweets to analyse and provide a fine-grained, highly
      personalised recommendation. One of the advantages of our
      system is its incremental training process that does not
      require the entire data to be available at once. An
      interactive front-end UI is also implemented to recommended
      green spaces based on user preferences and provide related
      information through a word cloud and users’ testimonials.</p>
