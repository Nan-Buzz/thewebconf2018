        <p><small>In the context of news recommendations, many
        time-aware approaches were proposed. These approaches have
        tried to capture the recency of news with respect to their
        short life span, by using either decaying weights on past
        articles or even forgetting them. However, most of these
        approaches have missed to consider sessions, which
        encapsulate inside them the articles that a user has
        interacted with in a short time period. In this paper, we
        provide news recommendations based on user sessions to
        reveal their short-term intentions. We also combine
        content-based with collaborative filtering to deal with the
        severe data sparsity problem that exists in our real-life
        data set. We have experimentally seen that the users’
        interests evolve over time and that our strategies can
        adapt fast to these changes.</small></p>

          Introduction</h2>

      <p>Content-based (CB) news recommendations build a user's
      profile based on the news articles that she has read in the
      past, and recommend to her similar articles. The main
      advantage of CB is that it alleviates the “cold start”
      problem (i.e. recommendations for new incoming items/users
      without ratings). However, CB cannot provide diversified
      recommendations, because it favors only articles similar to
      the user's historical profile. To overcome the aforementioned
      problem, Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommends articles
      that other similar users to the target user have read in the
      past. Another CF variation is the item-based CF algorithm
      [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>, <a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>], where
      given a target user and her positively rated news articles,
      the algorithm relies on the items’ similarities for the
      formation of a neighborhood of nearest items. For news
      recommendation, there are hybrid approaches that combine CB
      with CF algorithms [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] to deal with the aforementioned
      problems. However, even if these works take into account the
      time dimension (e.g., decay the weight of articles that are
      old, etc.), they miss to take under consideration the
      sessions, which can reveal the short term preferences of a
      user.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we provide news recommendations that use
      these short user sessions. The advantage of the session-based
      recommendation is that we concentrate mostly on the
      short-term intentions of a user. First, we formulate the
      problem of news recommendation and we present the main
      dynamics that govern it, such as recency of news, the life
      span of a news article or topic category, and the usage of a
      sliding time window to forget news articles that are old. Our
      proposed method builds a CB user profile, by identifying the
      main categories of news articles that a user is interested in
      (e.g., politics, sports, etc.). We also use a sliding time
      window to reduce the impact of news articles that have been
      clicked earlier in the past. Moreover, to reveal the
      short-term user's profile, we analyze the latest news
      articles that a user has read (i.e. in his last
      sessions).</p>

      <p>In this Section, we will present the main work in
      session-based recommenders and news recommender systems.</p>
      <p>Session-based recommendation usually refers to the case
      scenario, where we have only anonymous sessions and we are
      not able to build a user's profile [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>]. Recently, session-based
      recommendations have been modeled with Recurrent Neural
      Networks (RNNs). Hidasi et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger=
      "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>] presented a recommender system based
      on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which learns when and how much
      to update the hidden state of the GRU model. However, a more
      recent study [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] have shown that a simple
      <em>k</em>-nearest neighbor (kNN) scheme adapted for
      session-based recommendations often outperforms the GRU
      model. The authors claim that best results are achieved when
      a session-based kNN model is combined with GRU model in a
      weighted hybrid approach. Nevertheless, several adjustments
      were proposed during last years in order to improve the
      performances of the initial GRU model [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>, <a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>].</p>
      <p>For the news recommendation task based on short user
      sessions, Epure et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] considered three levels of reading
      interests based on time dimension: short-, medium-, and
      long-term. They also explored different combinations of these
      three levels to increase either the accuracy of stories
      recommendations or the diversity of the recommendation list.
      They have experimentally shown that recommendations based on
      combined short-term and long-term interests result in
      increased accuracy while recommendations based on combined
      short-term and medium-term interests can increase the
      diversity of the recommendations.</p>
      <p>Liu et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] combined the content-based method
      with the collaborative filtering method to generate
      personalized news recommendations. The hybrid method develops
      a Bayesian framework for predicting users’ current news
      interests based on profiles learned (i) from the target
      user's activity and (ii) the news trends demonstrated in the
      activity of all users. Li et al. [<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] proposed a novel
      recommendation approach, in which the long-term and
      short-term reading preferences of users are combined to
      recommend news stories. In particular, their method is based
      on a hierarchy of news stories (i.e. news categories) that a
      user might prefer. Ludmann's recommender system [<a class=
      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>], denoted
      as Ody4, won the CLEF NewsREEL 2017 contest, which was about
      recommending effectively and efficiently news articles. Ody4
      is a stream-based recommender system, which relies on the
      open source data stream management system Odysseus. Ody4
      continuously calculated the most popular and recent articles
      based on a stream of interaction events.</p>

      </header>
      <p>We are interested in providing recommendations for news
      web sites. These media provide news articles to interested
      content consumers (anonymous or registered users). For
      anonymous users, we do not have a user profile, instead, we
      store anonymous sessions together with the articles accessed
      during them. For registered users or those who have accepted
      cookies requests, we can keep track of all the interactions
      that they did in the past (i.e., we can build a user
      profile).</p>
      <p>Our recommender consists of two modules. The first is the
      profile updater, and the second is the recommender that runs
      on top of the profile updater to deliver the top-<em>N</em>
      recommended items to each user. The profile updater module
      reads instances from the stream of user sessions combining
      them with earlier recorded information on the participating
      entities (users, items, sessions). Thus, it assigns validity
      intervals to elements of the sessions stream <em>S</em>.
      Then, a sliding time window of size <em>w</em> states that
      the processing at a point in time <em>t</em> should consider
      all events not older than <em>t</em> − <em>w</em>. Therefore,
      the profile updater sets a validity interval [<em>t</em> −
      <em>w</em>, <em>t</em>) in which it computes the similarity
      among items based on either articles-sessions interactions
      (CF) or articles’ topic categories (CB). Then, this
      information is provided to the recommender module, to suggest
      top-<em>N</em> items to each user.</p>
      <p>For the news recommendation scenario, whenever a user
      reads one or more articles in a short time period (i.e., 30
      minutes), we store these interactions as a user's session.
      Formally, a session <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$S_n^u$</span></span> for
      a user <em>u</em> is defined as a set of items, that the user
      has interacted with, within a short time period, <span class=
      "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$S_n^u = (i_1, i_2,
      \ldots , i_m)$</span></span> . Since user-item interactions
      arrive at any time, a session is a stream. New users and new
      items may also arrive at any time. To further clear out our
      idea, we will use the running example shown in Figure
      <a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a>. In this running example,
      we have 4 users and we want to recommend the next story to
      user 3, who has an unfinished session (i.e. session
      <em>S</em> <sub>8</sub>). For computing the similarities
      between the session of the target user <em>U</em>
      <sub>3</sub> with the sessions of the other 3 users, please
      notice that sessions <em>S</em> <sub>1</sub>, <em>S</em>
      <sub>2</sub>, and <em>S</em> <sub>3</sub> cannot be
      considered, because they are outside of the sliding time
      window that we have set [<em>t</em> − <em>w</em>,
      <em>t</em>). This sliding time window captures the notion of
      recency of news stories. That is, as a news article has a
      short life span, which obsoletes fast, then, we should try to
      recommend more recent articles. The main idea of our paper is
      that items which are selected in the same sessions can be
      considered as more similar than those items that are selected
      from the same user in different sessions. For example, taking
      into account actions of user 3 (i.e., <em>U</em>
      <sub>3</sub>) we can infer that similarity between item
      <em>i</em> <sub>6</sub> with <em>i</em> <sub>3</sub> is
      bigger than the similarity between item <em>i</em>
      <sub>6</sub> with <em>i</em> <sub>1</sub> since they were
      selected within the same session <em>S</em> <sub>5</sub>.
      This methodology reveals also the short-term preference of
      the user and his intentions inside a session. We consider two
      aspects of similarity between item-session interactions and
      item-category correlations. In the following, we describe
      these two different types of similarity among items, and we
      explain how we can combine them into a single similarity
      function.</p>

        <p>In this Section, instead of using the classical
        user-item matrix we use the session-item matrix. The
        advantage of inferring item similarities from session
        interactions, instead of user interactions, is that we
        focus in the short term intentions of the user. Since we
        perform collaborative filtering on a stream of sessions and
        items, we slide a window of length <em>w</em> over the
        stream of interactions and consider at each time point
        <em>t</em> only the set of interactions inside the time
        window <em>t<sub>p</sub></em> = [<em>t</em> − <em>w</em>,
        <em>t</em>). We encode the session as a binary vector: For
        each session which is active in time period
        <em>t<sub>p</sub></em> , we set <em>r</em> <sub><em>s</em>,
        <em>i</em></sub> = 1 if item <em>i</em> is accessed inside
        section <em>s</em>, otherwise <em>r</em> <sub><em>s</em>,
        <em>i</em></sub> = 0. Thus, the similarity between item
        <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> is computed as follows:</p>

        respectively, within time period <em>t<sub>p</sub></em> .
        In our running example, <em>i</em> <sub>7</sub> would be
        recommended because it is more similar than <em>i</em>

        </header>
        <p>In this Section, we describe a content-based method to
        recommend news articles according to their topic
        categories. Based on the articles’ text, we train a topic
        model and we create for each article its topic category
        profile. That is, an article is represented by a
        probability distribution vector over the set of topic
        categories. Based on the user's news reading history within
        a specific time period <em>t<sub>p</sub></em> the profile
        updater computes the similarity matrix among items, based
        on the cosine similarity of each pair of article-category
        profiles. Let <em>f</em> <sub><em>c</em>, <em>i</em></sub>
        be the probability that an item <em>i</em> belongs to a
        topic category <em>c</em>. Then, the similarity between
        items <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> is computed as:</p>

            CB with Session-based CF</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p><em>simCF</em> matrix captures the interactions of
        sessions with articles. However, when sessions do not have
        many items, it is difficult to provide accurate
        recommendations. On the other hand, <em>simCB</em> matrix
        captures the topic categories profile of the articles.
        Thus, it is able to detect those items that belong to the
        same categories with those of the target item, alleviating
        the aforementioned problem. As our objective is to provide
        more accurate news recommendations, we combine the two
        similarity measures into a single one, which is given in
        Eq. <a class="eqn" href="#eq3">3</a>:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive" id="eq3">
          <div class="display-equation">
            <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation}
            simCBCF(t_p,i,j) = \alpha * simCB(t_p,i,j) + (1-\alpha)
            * simCF(t_p, i,j) \end{equation}</span><br />

          </div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>Please notice that in several cases the distribution of
        the similarity values between <em>simCF</em> and
        <em>simCB</em> may differ significantly. Therefore, in that
        case, we have to normalize in the interval [0,1] the values
        of the two similarity matrices before combining them.</p>

            Description and Log Analysis</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The data set is provided by an Italian news publisher
        that accommodated 14367 interactions/events on 2081
        articles of 14047 unique users in one year (i.e. from 1st
        April 2016 to 30th March 2017). An interaction is logged
        when an article is accessed on the news publisher's
        website. The interactions of each session are logged with
        the following information: the user session's identifier,
        the interaction's time stamp and duration, the article's
        textual content. Based on the articles’ text, we train a
        Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] model and found five
        topic categories in which an article may belong to. The
        topic categories that were found are “education”,
        “politics”, “sports”, “local news” and “justice”. Most of
        the user sessions have a very small number of interactions
        (i.e., 84% of sessions have only one interaction) as shown
        in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>, which should
        have a negative impact in the effectiveness of all
        recommendations algorithms. This explains the poor results
        for all methods in terms of precision@<em>N</em> that will
        be shown later. In addition, we have noticed big
        fluctuations of the crowd's reading trends during the year.
        Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> shows how the
        public interest evolves over the year, for the 5 topic
        categories (politics, education, sports, justice and local
        news). Please notice that some news categories (e.g., local
        news, education and politics) have greater variation than
        others (e.g. Sports and Justice). This happens because of
        some big events, e.g., the local elections of Alto Adige
        region in Italy was performed on May 2016, and politics
        attracted the people's interest, as shown in Figure
        <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>. Based on the above
        considerations, by using a smaller sliding time window
        size, we may identify faster when a topic category will
        attract the crowd's interest (concept drift), as will be
        later experimentally shown.</p>

            Recommendation Results</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>In this Section, we evaluate the precision@5 (i.e., the
        ratio of correctly predicted articles to the number of
        recommended ones) we get when we recommend top-5 articles
        to each user that was active in <em>t<sub>p</sub></em> and
        has at least one session in time period [<em>t</em>,
        <em>t</em> + 1), denoted also as <em>t</em> <sub><em>p</em>
        + 1</sub>. In other words, we evaluate item recommendations
        against the interactions appearing in <em>t</em>
        <sub><em>p</em> + 1</sub>, which we consider as future to
        evaluate our experiments. An important parameter for news
        recommendation is the window size of the interaction
        events. If this sliding time window is too large the system
        is not sensitive to changes (concept drifts), if it is too
        small there is not enough data to build a model for items
        or sessions.</p>
        <p>Next, we study the accuracy performance of CB and CF
        methods with different time period splits:
        <em>n<sub>t</sub></em> = 12, 24 and with various time
        window sizes: <em>w</em> = 1, 2, 3. We set the nearest
        neighbors <em>k</em>-nn = 20 for CF and <em>k</em>-nn = 30
        for CB, according to the best results achieved during the
        preliminary evaluation. In Figures <a class="fig" href=
        "#fig4">4</a> a, <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> b,
        <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> d, and <a class="fig"
        href="#fig4">4</a> e, we can see that the smallest window
        size <em>w</em> = 1 achieves the best result for almost all
        timepoints. As far as the time period splits is concerned,
        the best results are attained with 24 time splits, which
        means that forgetting fast older news is better. Please
        notice that when we run experiments with
        <em>n<sub>t</sub></em> = 52, precision decreased. As
        expected, CB is on average 40% better than CF, due to the
        extreme data sparsity (i.e. cold start problem) that exists
        in our real-life data set, as it is also shown in Figure
        <a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>. Next, we evaluate the
        combination of CB with CF (i.e. CBCF) with different
        weighting schemes: <em>α</em> = 1, 0.5, 0. As shown in
        Figures <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a> c and <a class=
        "fig" href="#fig4">4</a> f, for the 12 and 24 time splits,
        respectively, CBCF (i.e. the red dotted line) give us
        better results than those of simple CF and CB at least in
        some time points. This is an encouraging result, which
        could be further optimized by learning a model for
        parameter <em>α</em> using either a regression model or a
        neural network. Finally, in Table <a class="tbl" href=
        "#tab1">1</a> we report the average precision results over
        the whole year for CBCF against the popularity baseline
        (POP), which recommends the most popular articles in the
        time window <em>t<sub>p</sub></em> . To include also a
        static variation of both algorithms, we run experiments
        with <em>n<sub>t</sub></em> = 2, in addition to the
        <em>n<sub>t</sub></em> = 12 and <em>n<sub>t</sub></em> =
        24. As shown in Table <a class="tbl" href="#tab1">1</a>,
        CBCF outperforms POP baseline in all cases. As expected,
        both static models perform poorly, because they recommend
        articles published during a time period of six months,
        ignoring the fact that articles have a short lifespan
        (e.g., some weeks).</p>
