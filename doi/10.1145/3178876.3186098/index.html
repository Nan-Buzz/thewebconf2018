        <p><small>Technical Support Scams (TSS), which combine
        online abuse with social engineering over the phone
        channel, have persisted despite several law enforcement
        actions. Although recent research has provided important
        insights into TSS, these scams have now evolved to exploit
        ubiquitously used online services such as search and
        sponsored advertisements served in response to search
        queries. We use a data-driven approach to understand
        search-and-ad abuse by TSS to gain visibility into the
        online infrastructure that facilitates it. By carefully
        formulating tech support queries with multiple search
        engines, we collect data about both the support
        infrastructure and the websites to which TSS victims are
        directed when they search online for tech support
        resources. We augment this with a DNS-based amplification
        technique to further enhance visibility into this abuse
        infrastructure. By analyzing the collected data, we provide
        new insights into search-and-ad abuse by TSS and reinforce
        some of the findings of earlier research. Further, we
        demonstrate that tech support scammers are (1) successful
        in getting major as well as custom search engines to return
        links to websites controlled by them, and (2) they are able
        to get ad networks to serve malicious advertisements that
        lead to scam pages. Our study period of approximately eight
        months uncovered over 9,000 TSS domains, of both passive
        and aggressive types, with minimal overlap between sets
        that are reached via organic search results and sponsored
        ads. Also, we found over 2,400 support domains which aid
        the TSS domains in manipulating organic search results.
        Moreover, to our surprise, we found very little overlap
        with domains that are reached via abuse of domain parking
        and URL-shortening services which was investigated
        previously. Thus, investigation of search-and-ad abuse
        provides new insights into TSS tactics and helps detect
        previously unknown abuse infrastructure that facilitates
        these scams.</small></p>

      <p>The <em>Technical Support Scam</em> (TSS), in which
      scammers dupe their victims into sending hundreds of dollars
      for fake technical support services, is now almost a decade
      old. It started with scammers making cold calls to victims
      claiming to be a legitimate technology vendor but has now
      evolved into the use of sophisticated online abuse tactics to
      get customers to call phone numbers that are under the
      control of the scammers. In their research on
      TSS&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>],
      Miramirkhani et. al. explored both the web infrastructure
      used by tech support scammers and the tactics used by them
      when a victim called a phone number advertised on a TSS
      website. They focused on TSS websites reached via malicious
      advertisements that are served by abusing domain parking and
      ad-based URL shortening services. Although their work
      provided important insights into how these services are
      abused by TSS, it has recently become clear that tech support
      scammers are diversifying their methods of reaching victims
      and convincing these victims to call them on their advertised
      phone numbers. Recent reports by the US Federal Trade
      Commission (FTC) and by search engines vendors suggest that
      scammers are turning to search engine results and the ads
      shown on search-results pages to reach their
      victim&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>,
      <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"

      "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
      data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>]. These new
      channels not only allow them to reach a wider audience but
      also help them diversify the ways in which they convince
      users to call them. Both government regulators and companies
      have taken action to stop TSS but these scams continue to
      adapt and evade their efforts&nbsp;[<a class="bib"

      <p>In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of
      TSS abuse of search-and-ad channels. We develop a model for
      generating tech-support related queries and use the resulting
      2,600 queries as daily searches in popular and less popular
      search engines. By crawling the organic search results and
      ads shown in response to our queries (note that we follow a
      methodology that allows us to visit the websites of ads while
      avoiding click-fraud), we discover thousands of domains and
      phone numbers associated with TSS. In addition to the
      traditional <em>aggressive</em> variety of TSS where visited
      webpages attempt to scare users into calling them, we observe
      a large number of <em>passive</em> TSS pages which appear to
      be professional, yet nevertheless are operated by technical
      support scammers. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
      "#fig1">1</a> shows an example of such a scam. Using
      network-amplification techniques, we show how we can discover
      many more scam pages present on the same network
      infrastructure, and witness the co-location of aggressive
      with passive scam pages. This indicates that a fraction of
      these aggressive/passive scams are, in fact, controlled and
      operated by the same scammers. Our main contributions are the
      following:</p>
      <ul class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list1" label="•">We design the first
        search-engine-based system for discovering TSS, and utilize
        it for eight months to uncover more than 9,000 TSS-related
        domains and 3,365 phone numbers operated by technical
        support scammers, present in both organic search results as
        well as ads located on search-results pages. We analyze the
        resulting data and provide details of the abused
        infrastructure, the SEO techniques that allow scammers to
        rank well on search engines, and the long-lived
        <em>support</em> domains which allow TSS domains to remain
        hidden from search engines.<br /></li>
        <li id="list2" label="•">We find that scammers are
        complementing their aggressive TSS pages with passive ones,
        which both cater to different audiences and, due to their
        non-apparent malice, have a significantly longer lifetime.
        We show that well-known network amplification techniques
        allow us to not only discover more TSS domains but to also
        trace both aggressive and passive TSS back to the same
        actors.<br /></li>
        <li id="list3" label="•">We compare our results with the
        ones from the recent TSS study of Miramirkhani et
        al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
          data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
          "#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>] and show that the vast majority
          of our discovered abusive infrastructure is not detected
          by prior work, allowing defenders to effectively
          <em>double</em> their coverage of TSS abuse
          infrastructure by incorporating our techniques into their
          existing TSS-discovering systems. Thus, our system
          reveals part of the TSS ecosystem that remained, up until
          now, unexplored.<br />

      <p>We utilize a data-driven methodology to explore TSS
      tactics and infrastructure used to support search-and-ad
      abuse. To do this, we search and crawl the web to collect a
      variety of data about TSS websites. Our system, which is
      shown in Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig2">2</a>,
      implements TSS data collection and analysis functions, and
      consists of the following six modules:</p>
      <ol class="list-no-style">
        <li id="list4" label="(1)">The <em>Seed Generator</em>
        module generates phrases that are likely to be used in
        search queries to find tech support resources. It uses a
        known corpus of TSS webpages obtained from Malwarebytes
        [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
          data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>] and a
          probabilistic language modeling technique to generate
          such search phrases.<br />
        </li>
        <li id="list5" label="(2)">Using search phrases, the
        <em>Search Engine Crawler (SEC)</em> module mines popular
        search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! for
        technical support related content appearing via search
        results (SRs) and sponsored advertisements (ADs). We also
        mine a few obscure ones such as goentry.com and
        search.1and1.com that we discovered are used by tech
        support scammers.<br /></li>
        <li id="list6" label="(3)">The <em>Active Crawler Module
        (ACM)</em> then tracks and records the URI redirection
        events, HTML content, and DNS information associated with
        the URIs/domains appearing in the ADs and SRs crawled by
        the SEC module.<br /></li>
        <li id="list7" label="(4)"><em>Categorization module</em>
        which includes a well-trained TSS website classifier, is
        used to identify TSS SRs and ADs using the retrieved

        <li id="list8" label="(5)">The <em>Network Amplification
        Module (NAM)</em> uses DNS data to amplify signals obtained

        expand the set of domains serving TSS, using an
        amplification algorithm.<br /></li>
        <li id="list9" label="(6)">Lastly, using the information
        gathered about TSS domains, the <em>Clustering Module</em>

        <p>We must generate search phrases that are highly likely
        to be associated with content shown or advertised in TSS
        webpages to feed to the search engine crawler module.
        Deriving relevant search queries from a context specific
        corpus has been used effectively in the past for measuring
        search-redirection attacks&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0050">50</a>]. We use an approach
        based on joint probability of words in phrases in a given
        text corpus&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0052">52</a>]. We start with a corpus of 500
        known TSS websites from the Malwarebytes TSS domain
        blacklist (DBL)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>], whose webpage content was
        available. We were able to find 869 unigrams or single
        words after sanitizing the content in the corpus for stop
        words. We then rank these unigrams based on the TF-IDF
        weighting factor and pick the most important unigrams as an
        initial step. This leaves us with seventy four unique
        words. Using the raw counts of unigrams, we compute the raw
        bi-gram probabilities of eligible phrases with the chain
        rule of probability. We then use the Markov assumption to
        approximate n-gram probabilities&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>]. Table&nbsp;<a class=
        "tbl" href="#tab1">1</a> shows the total number of phrases
        found for different values of <em>n</em> and some examples
        of the phrases found. We restricted the value of <em>n</em>
        to 7, as the value of <em>n</em> = 8 does not yield any
        significant phrases. This way, we were able to identify
        2600 English phrases that serve as search queries to the
        SEC module.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The SEC module uses a variety of search engines and the
        search phrases generated from the TSS corpus to capture two
        types of listing: traditional search results, sometimes
        also referred to as organic search results, and search
        advertisements, sometimes also referred to as
        paid/sponsored advertisements. Both Google [<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>] and Bing [<a class=
        "bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover"
        data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>] provide
        APIs that can be used to get SRs. However, some of the
        search engines we considered did not have well documented
        APIs and vanilla crawlers are either blocked or not shown
        content such as ADs. In such cases, we automate the process
        using PhantomJS [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>], a headless WebKit “scriptable”
        with a JavaScript API. It allows us to capture both SR and
        AD listings as it would be shown to a real user visiting
        the search engine from an actual browser.</p>
        <p>Once we have the raw page <em>p</em> from the search
        engine in response to a query <em>q</em>, we use
        straighforward CSS selectors to separate the SRs from ADs.
        A SR object typically consists of basic components such as
        the the SR title, the SR URI, and a short snippet of the SR
        content. An AD object too, typically consists of these
        components, i.e. the AD title, the advertiser's URI/domain
        name, and a short descriptive text. The advertiser also
        provides the URI the user should be directed to when the AD
        is clicked. The SR/AD along with its components are logged
        into a database as a JSON object. The URI component of the
        ADs and SRs are then inserted into the ADC (AD crawling)
        and SRC (SR crawling) queues respectively, which then
        coordinate with the ACM to gather more information about
        them.</p>

            Crawler Module (ACM)</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The ACM uses the ADC and SRC URI queues to gather more
        information relevant to an AD/SR. ACM has three submodules
        that keep track of the following information for each URI
        seen in the AD/SR: (i) URI tracking, (ii) HTML and
        Screenshot Capture, and (iii) DNS information.</p>
        <p><strong>URI Tracker:</strong> The purpose of the URI
        tracker is to follow and log the redirection events
        starting from the URI component seen in the AD/SR discussed
        in the previous module. Barring user clicks, our goal is to
        capture the sequence of events that a user on a real
        browser would experience when directed to technical support
        scams from SR/AD results, and <em>automate</em> this
        process. Our system uses a combination of python modules
        PhantomJS&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>], Selenium&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>] and
        BeautifulSoup&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] to script a light-weight headless
        browser. Finally, to ensure wide coverage, we configure our
        crawlers with different combinations of Referer headers and
        User-Agents.</p>
        <p><em>Mimicking AD Clicks:</em> When a user clicks on an
        AD, the click triggers a sequence of events in which the
        publisher, AD network and advertiser are involved, before
        the user lands on the intended webpage associated with the
        AD. Clearly, the intent of our automated crawlers is not to
        interfere with the AD monetization model by introducing
        extraneous clicks. One alternative to actually clicking on
        the ADs and a way to bypass the AD network is to visit the
        advertiser's domain name directly, while maintaining the
        <em>Referer</em> to be the search engine displaying the AD.
        In theory, any further redirections from the advertiser's
        domain should still be captured.</p>
        <p>To validate if this was a viable option while
        maintaining accuracy of the data collection process, we
        conducted a controlled experiment in which we compared a
        small number of recorded URI resolution paths generated by
        real clicks to paths recorded while visiting the
        advertiser's domain name directly. We did this for the same
        set of technical support ADs while keeping the same browser
        and IP settings. For a set of 50 fake technical support ADs
        from different search engines identified manually and at
        random, these paths were found to be identical giving us
        confidence in this approach.</p>
        <p><strong>HTML Crawler:</strong> The HTML crawler works in
        conjunction with the URI Tracker and captures both the raw
        HTML as well as visual screenshots of webpages shown after
        following the ADs and SRs. For each domain <em>d</em> and
        webpage <em>p</em>, in the path from an AD/SR to the
        final-landing webpage, the crawler stores the full source
        HTML and an image of the webpage as it would have appeared
        in a browser, into a database.</p>
        <p><strong>Active DNS Crawler:</strong> For each domain,
        <em>d</em>, in the path from an AD/SR to the final-landing
        domain, the active DNS crawler logs the IP address,
        <em>ip</em>, associated with the domain to form a
        (<em>d</em>, <em>ip</em>, <em>t</em>) triplet, based on the
        DNS resolution process at the time of crawling, <em>t</em>.
        This information is valuable for unearthing new technical
        support scam domains (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=

        <p>Although we input technical support phrases to search
        engines with the aim of finding fake technical support
        websites, it is possible and even likely that some SRs and
        ADs lead to websites that are legitimate technical support
        or even completely unrelated to technical support. To
        categorize all search engine listings obtained during the
        period of data collection, we first divide the URIs
        collected from both ADs and SRs into two high-level
        categories: TSS and Non-TSS, (i.e. those URIs that lead to
        technical support scam pages and those that lead to benign
        or unrelated pages). Within each category, we have
        subcategories: TSS URIs are further separated into those
        leading to aggressive TSS websites and those leading to
        passive TSS websites.</p>
        <p><strong>TSS Website Classifier:</strong> We determine an
        AD/SR as technical support scam or not primarily based on
        the webpage content shown in the final-landing domain
        corresponding to an AD/SR. We leverage the observation that
        a lot of fake technical support websites host highly
        similar content, language and words to present
        themselves&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>]. This can be represented as a
        feature vector where features are the words and values are
        the frequency counts of those words. Thus, for a collection
        of labeled TSS and Non-TSS websites, we extract the bag of
        words after sanitization (such as removing stop words), and
        create a matrix of feature vectors where the rows are the
        final-landing domains and the columns are the text
        features. We can then train a classifier on these features
        which can be used to automatically label future
        websites.</p>
        <p>To that effect, we built a model using the Naive Bayes
        classification algorithm with 10-fold cross validation on a
        set comprising of 500 technical support scam and 500
        non-technical support scam websites identified from the
        first few weeks of ADs/SRs data. The training set is
        randomly selected and manually labeled. The selection
        consists of representative samples of different kinds of
        TSS webpages, both passive and aggressive types, along with
        Non-TSS webpages that were found among the search listings
        including benign or unrelated webpages. The performance of
        the classifier is captured in the ROC Curve shown in
        Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>. We see that
        a threshold of 0.6 yields to an acceptable true positive
        rate (TPR) of 98.9% and a false positive rate (FPR) of
        1.5%. Moreover the area under the curve (AUC), which is a
        measure of the overall accuracy of the trained model, is
        99.33% which gives us confidence that the technical vs.
        non-technical support webpage classification works well. To
        make sure, we are not including, genuine, popular and high
        reputation technical support service websites in our TSS
        dataset, eg. Best Buy's Geek Squad&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=

        <p></p>
        <p>Next, to separate TSS URIs into those leading to
        passive/aggressive websites, we use the presence of
        features extracted from the HTML of the landing TSS
        website. Aggressive TSS websites exhibit behavior that
        contributes to a false sense of urgency and panic through a
        combination of audio messages describing the problem and
        continuous pop-up messages/dialogue loops which can be
        detected using tags such as &lt; audio &gt; ,
        window.alert(), window.confirm(), window.prompt() etc. On
        the other hand, passive TSS websites adopt the approach of
        seeming genuine. This is accomplished by using simple
        textual content, certifications, seals, and other
        brand-based images. They often present themselves as
        official tech support representatives of large companies
        and, because of their non-apparent malice, pose new
        challenges for the detection of TSS&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>].</p>
        <p>To evaluate the performance of this TSS classifier, we
        sample data from the test AD/SR dataset. To verify actual
        TSS websites, we use Malwarebytes&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>] TSS blacklist data as
        an independent source of ground truth. The blacklist
        consists of domain names and phone numbers that serve both
        passive and aggressive TSS. However, certain websites from
        the test set that are marked as TSS may not be listed in
        Malwarebytes. For these, we use a combination of manual
        analysis of the website content, IP co-location indicators,
        WHOIS giveaways and relevant online complaints associated
        with the advertised phone number to verify that the website
        is indeed associated with TSS. While aggressive TSS
        websites are easy to verify using characteristics of the
        website content itself, passive TSS websites require
        additional work for verification. Instead of calling the
        phone numbers listed on websites classified as passive TSS,
        we use clues mentioned previously to create TSS ground
        truth with reasonable confidence. For instance, in
        Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-19">3.3</a>, we show
        that indeed, some of the passive scams are operated out of
        the same IP infrastructure that runs the aggressive ones,
        giving us confidence in creating ground truth on passive
        TSS websites based partially on this feature. Using this
        strategy, we were able to evaluate the performance of the
        classifier on a ground truth dataset consisting of 200 TSS
        websites and 200 Non-TSS websites, sampled randomly from
        the test set. Among the TSS websites, there were 100
        aggressive and 100 passive TSS websites in the ground truth
        set. 114/200 (76 aggressive and 38 passive) TSS websites
        were verified via Malwarebytes and the remaining 86 (24
        aggressive and 62 passive) websites were verified via a
        mixture of aforementioned clues. We note that some of these
        clues are better used as indicators/heuristics rather than
        conventional classifier features due to the inconsistent
        nature of some of these records – eg. WHOIS
        records&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0051">51</a>].</p>
        <p>Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab2">2</a> shows the
        confusion matrix related to this experiment. The TSS
        classifier was able to achieve a reasonable 98% TPR and low
        0.5% FPR on the testing set, thus validating the TSS
        website classification methodology. Also, there was 100%
        accuracy in distinguishing passive from aggressive TSS
        websites using the aforementioned heuristics. In the
        future, we seek to add more distinguishing features to our
        classifier and scale our experiment using additional
        independent sources of ground truth data.</p>

        <p>Using search listings to identify active TSS websites
        works well for creating an initial level of intelligence
        around these scams. However, it may be possible to expand
        this intelligence to uncover more domains supporting TSS
        that may have been missed by our crawler. The give-away for
        these additional TSS domains could be the sharing of
        network-level infrastructure with already identified TSS
        domains. A DNS request results in a domain name,
        <em>d</em>, being resolved to an IP address, <em>ip</em>,
        at a particular time, <em>t</em>, forming a (<em>d</em>,

        <em>RHIP</em>(<em>d</em>), which is a set of all IPs that
        have mapped to domain <em>d</em> as recorded by the DNS
        Crawler (Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
        "#sec-12">2.3</a>) within time window <em>T</em>, and (ii)
        <em>RHDN</em>(<em>ip</em>), which is the set of domains
        that have historically been linked with the <em>ip</em> or
        <em>ip</em>/24 subnet in the <em>RHIP</em> set within time
        window <em>T</em> ± <em>Δ</em>, where <em>Δ</em> is also a
        unit of time (typically one week). Next, we compute
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathcal
        {D}_{rhip-rhdn}(d)$</span></span> , which represents all
        the domains related to <em>d</em> at the network level, as
        discovered by the <em>RHIP</em>-<em>RHDN</em> expansion.
        Now, for each domain <span class=
        "inline-equation"><span class="tex">$d^{\prime } \in
        \mathcal {D}_{rhip-rhdn}(d)$</span></span> , we check if
        the webpage <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$w_{d^{\prime }}$</span></span> associated with it is
        a TSS webpage using the classifier module,
        Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-13">2.4</a>. Only if
        it is true, we add <em>d</em>′ to an amplification set,
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathcal
        {D}^{\prime }_{f-tss}(d)$</span></span> , associated with
        <em>d</em> since co-location can sometimes be

        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0063">63</a>]. The cardinality of the eventual
        amplification set gives us the amplification factor,
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathcal
        {A}(d)$</span></span> . Finally, we define the expanded set
        of TSS domains, <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\mathcal {E}_{f-tss}$</span></span> , as the union
        of all amplification sets. Combining the initial set of
        domains, <span class="inline-equation"><span class=
        "tex">$\mathcal {D}_{f-tss}$</span></span> , with the
        expanded set, <span class="inline-equation"><span class=

        final set of fake-technical support domains <span class=

            Module</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The purpose of the clustering module is to identify
        different TSS campaigns. We identify the campaigns by
        finding clusters of related domain names associated with
        abuse in a given time period or epoch <em>t</em>. A two
        step hierarchical clustering process is used. In the first
        level, referred to as Network CLustering (NCL), we cluster
        together domain names based on the network infrastructure
        properties. In the second level, referred to as Application
        CLustering (ACL), we further separate the network level
        clusters based on the application level web content
        associated with the domains in them.</p>
        <p>In order to execute these two different clustering
        steps, we employ the most common statistical features from
        the areas of DNS&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0065">65</a>] and HTML&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0061">61</a>, <a class="bib"
        data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
        "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0065">65</a>] modeling to build our
        feature vector. In NCL, we use Singular Value Decomposition
        (SVD)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0069">69</a>] to reduce the dimensionality of
        the sparse feature matrix, and then use the X-Means
        clustering algorithm&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0058">58</a>] to cluster domains having similar
        network-level properties. To further refine the clusters
        with ACL, we use features extracted from the full HTML
        source of the web pages associated with domains in
        <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$\mathcal
        {F}_{f-tss}$</span></span> . We compute TF-IDF statistical
        vector on the bag of words on each cluster
        <em>c</em>&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0061">61</a>]. Once we have the reduced
        application based feature vectors representing
        corresponding domains with SVD, this module too uses the
        X-Means clustering algorithm to cluster domains hosting
        similar content.</p>
        <p><strong>Campaign Labels:</strong> This submodule is used
        to label clusters with keywords that are representative of
        a campaign's theme. Let <em>C</em> be a cluster produced
        after NCL and ACL, and let <em>D<sub>C</sub></em> be the
        set of domains in the cluster. For each domain <em>d</em> ∈
        <em>D<sub>C</sub></em> , we create a set
        <em>U</em>(<em>d</em>, <em>T</em>) that consists of all the
        parts of the domain name <em>d</em> except the effective
        top level domain (eTLD) and all parts of the corresponding
        webpage title <em>T</em>. Next, we compute the set of words
        <em>W</em>(<em>U</em>(<em>d</em>)) using the Viterbi
        algorithm&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0043">43</a>]. Using W, we increment the
        frequency counter for the words in a cluster specific
        dictionary. In this manner, after iterating over all
        domains in the cluster, we get a keyword to frequency
        mapping from which we pick the top most frequent word(s) to
        attribute to the cluster.</p>

      <p>We built and deployed the system described in
      Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-9">2</a> to collect
      and analyze SR and AD domains for TSS. Although the system
      continues to be in operation, the results discussed in this
      section are based on data that was collected over a period of
      8 months in two distinct time windows, April 1 to August 31,
      2016 initially, and again between Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2017, to
      study the long running nature of TSS. We crawled 5 search
      engines for both ADs and SRs, which include Google.com,
      Bing.com, Yahoo.com, Goentry.com and search.1and1.com. Each
      day, the SEC module automatically sends 2,600 different
      queries, as discussed in Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href=
      "#sec-10">2.1</a> for technical support-related terms to the
      various search engines. We consider the top 100 SR URIs
      (unless there are fewer) while recording all the AD URIs
      displayed for each query.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>In total we collected 14,346 distinct AD URIs and
        109,657 distinct SR URIs. Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
        "#tab3">3</a> presents the breakdown of all the search
        listings into the different categories. The AD URIs mapped
        to 4,954 unique Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), while
        the SR URIs mapped to 20,463 unique FQDNs. Among the AD
        URIs, 10,299 (71.79%) were observed as leading to TSS
        websites. This is a significant portion and shows that ADs
        related to technical support queries are dominated by those
        that lead to scams. It also means that the technical
        support scammers are actively bidding in the AD ecosystem
        to flood the AD networks with rogue technical support ADs,
        especially in response to technical support queries. Such
        prevalence of TSS ADs is the reason why Bing announced a
        blanket ban on online tech support ADs on its
        platform&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] in mid-May, 2016. The TSS AD URIs
        mapped to 2132 FQDNs. Among the TSS AD URIs and
        corresponding FQDNs, we found the presence of both
        aggressive and passive websites. More than two thirds of
        the URIs were seen to lead to aggressive websites. The
        ratio between aggressive and passive websites was closer to
        4:3 when considering just the TSS AD FQDNs. Past research
        has only investigated aggressive TSS websites, but our
        results show that passive websites are also a serious
        problem. We did observe legitimate technical support
        service AD URIs and FQDNs (13.19% of all AD URIs and 29.10%
        of all AD FQDNs).</p>
        <p>Among the SR URIs, 59,500 (54.26%) were observed leading
        to TSS websites. The URIs mapped to 3,583 (17.51%) FQDNs.
        Among the TSS SR URIs, we again found the presence of those
        leading to both aggressive and passive TSS varieties. The
        sheer number of such URIs is surprising as, unlike ADs, it
        is harder to manipulate popular search engine algorithms to
        make rogue websites appear in search results. However, as
        we discuss later, we observe that using black hat SEO
        techniques, TSS actors are able to trick the search engine
        ranking algorithms. Compared to ADs, we found that almost
        76% TSS SR URIs lead to aggressive TSS websites while the
        remaining lead to passive TSS websites, again pointing to
        the prevalence of the common tactic of scare and
        sell&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
        "popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>]. Although TSS SR URIs were
        frequently seen interspersed in search results, SR URIs
        also consisted of non-TSS ones. Among these we observed
        3.39% legitimate technical support service URIs, 9.13%
        blog/forum URIs, 9.12% URIs linked to complaint websites
        and 11.05% URIs pointing to news articles (mostly on TSS).
        The remaining 13.05% URIs were uncategorized.</p>
        <p>We also report aggregate statistics for FQDNs after
        combining ADs and SRs data. We see that in total there were
        5134 TSS FQDNs found, with URIs corresponding to 3166 FQDNs
        leading to aggressive websites and 1968 leading to passive
        websites. These together comprise of about 22.1% of the
        total number, 23,195 FQDNs retrieved from the entire
        dataset. One interesting observation is that majority of
        the FQDNs seen in ADs were not seen in the SRs and vice
        versa, with only a small amount of overlap in the TSS AD
        FQDNs and TSS SR FQDNs, consisting of 581 FQDNs. It
        suggests that the resources deployed for TSS ADs are
        different from those appearing in TSS SRs.</p>

        <p><strong>Support and Final-landing TSS domains:</strong>
        The purpose of <em>support</em> domains is to conduct black
        hat SEO and redirect victims to TSS domains but not host
        TSS content directly. We found 61.7% of the TSS search
        listing URIs redirected to a domain different from the one
        in the initial URI, while the remaining 38.3% did not
        redirect to a different domain. There were an additional,
        2,435 <em>support</em> domains found. Moreover, popular URL
        shortening and redirection services such as bit.ly or
        goo.gl were noticeably missing.</p>
        <p>When a TSS URI appearing in the search listings is
        clicked, it leads to the webpage that lures the victim into
        the scam. This webpage could be hosted on the same domain
        as the domain of the URI, or on a different domain. We
        refer to this final domain name associated with the TSS
        webpage as the <em>final-landing</em> TSS domain.
        Furthermore, it is possible that the path from the initial
        SR/AD URI to the final-landing TSS domain consists of other
        intermediate domains, which are mainly used for the purpose
        of redirecting the victim's browser. This is discussed in
        Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-12">2.3</a>.
        Figure&nbsp;4a plots the number of final-landing TSS
        domains discovered by our system over time across the
        various search engines. A bi-weekly trend shows that,
        across all search engines, we are able to consistently find
        hundreds of final-landing TSS domains and webpages. Bing,
        Google, Goentry, Yahoo and search.1and1.com, all act as
        origination points to TSS webpages. Starting mid-May 2016,
        we see a sudden dip in the number of TSS domains found on
        Bing. We suspect that this is most likely correlated to
        Bing's blanket ban on technical support
        advertisements&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. However, as we can see, activity,
        contributing mainly to SR based TSS, picked up again during
        July, 2016, continuing an upward trend in Jan to Mar 2017.
        Goentry, which was a major source of technical support ADs
        leading to final-landing TSS domains during our initial
        period of data collection saw a significant dip during the
        second time window. We suspect this may be due to our data
        collection infrastructure being detected (refer
        Section&nbsp;<a class="sec" href="#sec-23">5</a>) or law
        enforcement actions against technical support scammers in
        India&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

        "#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>], which is where the website is
        registered. In total we were able to discover 1,626 unique
        AD originated final-landing TSS FQDNs, and 2,682 unique SR
        originated final-landing TSS FQDNs. Together, we were able
        to account for 3,996 unique final-landing TSS FQDNs that
        mapped to 3,878 unique final-landing TSS TLD+1 domain
        names.</p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.2</span> Search
            Phrases Popularity and SR Rankings</h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Since we use search queries to retrieve SRs and ADs, one
        may question the popularity of search phrases used in these
        queries. We use popularity level derived from Google's
        keyword planner tool&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=
        "hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>] that is offered as part of its
        AdWords program. Figure&nbsp;4b shows the distribution of
        technical support search phrases based on their popularity.
        We can see that out of the 2600 phrases associated with
        TSS, about one third (32.7%) were of very low popularity,
        e.g. <em>‘kaspersky phone support’</em> with less than 100
        average global monthly searches, one third (33.5%) were of
        low popularity, e.g. <em>‘norton antivirus technical
        support’</em> with 101-1,000 hits per month on average,
        while there were 25.1% phrases that had medium levels of
        popularity, e.g. <em>‘hp tech support phone number’</em>
        with 1,001-10,000 average hits. At the higher end, 7% of
        the technical support phrases had moderately high levels of
        popularity, e.g. <em>‘dell tech support’, ’microsoft
        support number’</em> with 10,001-100,000 hits per month on
        average, and 1.7% of the technical support search phrases
        were highly searched for, e.g. <em>‘lenovo support’</em>
        with greater than 100,000 hits per month globally.</p>
        <p>One may expect that less popular search terms are prone
        to manipulation in the context of both ADs and SRs, while
        more popular ones are harder to manipulate due to
        competition via bidding (in the case of ADs) or SEO (in the
        case of SRs). To validate this, we measure the number of
        total TSS URIs found per search phrase (referred to as
        <em>pollution</em> level), as a function of the popularity
        of the phrase. Since the popularity levels of phrases are
        gathered from Google, we only consider the TSS URIs (both
        AD and SR as seen on Google) to make a fair assessment.
        Figure&nbsp;4c depicts a box plot that captures the
        pollution levels for all search phrases grouped by the
        popularity levels except the ones with very low popularity.
        By comparing the median number of TSS URIs (depicted by the
        red line(s)) from different popularity bands, we witness
        that as the popularity level of a search term increases,
        the pollution level, decreases. We can make several
        additional observations: (i) there is definite pollution
        irrespective of the popularity level: in other words, more
        than a single TSS URI appeared in almost all of the
        technical support search queries we considered, as can be
        seen from the floor of the first quartile in every band;
        (ii) while many (∼ 50%) low popularity search terms (e.g.
        those with 101-1000 hits per month) yielded 28 or more TSS
        URIs, there were outliers even among the high popularity
        search terms that accounted for the same or even more
        number of TSS URIs; and lastly, (iii) the range in the
        number of TSS URIs discovered per query varied more widely
        in the case of low popularity terms as compared to higher
        popularity terms.</p>
        <p>To effectively target victims, it is not merely enough
        to make TSS URIs appear among the search results. It is
        also important to make them appear high in the search
        rankings. To measure this, we show the distribution of TSS
        SR URIs based on their ranking/position among the search
        results for different search engines. We use four brackets
        to classify the TSS SR URIs based on its actual position:
        1-25 position (high rank), 26-50 position, 51-75 position
        and 76-100 position (low rank). If the same URI appears in
        multiple search positions, for example on different days,
        we pick and associate the higher of the positions with the
        URI. We do this to reflect the worst-case impact of a TSS
        SR URI. Thus, each unique URI is eventually counted only
        once. Figure&nbsp;4d summarizes our findings. We see that
        all 5 search engines return TSS URIs that are crowding out
        legitimate technical support websites by appearing high in
        the rankings. For a more fine grained analysis of the
        rankings and its potential impact, out of the top 25
        positions, we measured the fraction of TSS SR URIs
        appearing in the top three as well as the top ten
        positions. We found that Bing had the highest percentage,
        8% of TSS SR URIs appearing among the top three positions
        and 17% TSS SR URIs appearing in a top ten spot. Even the
        other search engines had their top three and top ten search
        positions polluted regularly by TSS URIs. This makes it
        hard to trust a high ranking URI as legitimate.</p>

        the final-landing websites in search listings and 5,225
        additional TSS FQDNs discovered as a result of
        network-level amplification. These 9,221 FQDNs mapped to
        8,104 TLD+1 domains. Thus, even though amplification is
        non-uniform, it helps in discovering domains that may not
        be visible by search listings alone. The network
        amplification process also allowed us to identify 840
        passive-type TSS domains co-located with one or more
        aggressive TSS domains. This indicates that some of the
        passive scams are operated by the same scammers who operate

        <p><strong>Most abused TLDs:</strong> First, we analyze the
        final-landing TSS domain names. Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl"
        href="#tab4">4</a> shows the most abused TLDs in this
        category. The <em>.com</em> TLD appeared in 25.56%
        final-landing TSS domain names, making it the most abused
        TLD. Next, 16.21% domain names had <em>.xyz</em> as the
        TLD, making it the second most abused TLD. <em>.info</em>,
        <em>.online</em> and <em>.us</em> each had greater than 6%
        domain names registered to them completing the top five in
        this category. Other popular gTLDs included <em>.website,
        .site, .tech, .support</em>, while the ccTLDs included
        <em>.in, .tk, .co</em> and <em>.tf</em>. Among the
        <em>support</em> domains, the top three most popular TLDs
        were <em>.xyz, .win</em> and <em>.space</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Domains Lifetimes:</strong> The lifetime of a
        final-landing TSS domain is derived by computing the
        difference between the earliest and most recent date that
        the domain was seen hosting TSS content. The lifetime of a
        support domain is derived based on earliest and the most
        recent date that the domain was seen redirecting to a
        final-landing TSS domain. Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href=
        "#fig6">6</a> plots the lifetimes of these two categories
        of domains with the final-landing domains split up into the
        passive and aggressive types. Final-landing TSS domains of
        the aggressive type had a median lifetime of ∼ 9 days with
        close to 40% domains having a lifetime between 10-100 days,
        and the remaining ∼ 10% domains having a lifetime greater
        than a 100 days. In comparison, final-landing TSS domains
        of the passive type had a much longer median lifetime of ∼
        100 days. Some of the domains in this category had a
        lifetime of over 300 days. Clearly, passive TSS domains
        outlast those of the aggressive type. In comparison,
        support domains had a median lifetime of ∼ 60 days, with ∼
        33% domains having a lifetime greater than 100 days.
        Generally, this is a longer lifetime relative to
        final-landing TSS domains of the aggressive type. To
        provide context, phishing websites have a median lifetime
        of only 20 hours&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
        data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
        "#BibPLXBIB0054">54</a>]. As we discuss later, in addition
        to blacklisting the final-landing domains, take
        down/blacklisting of these <em>support</em> domains would
        lead to a more effective defense in breaking parts of the
        TSS abuse infrastructure.</p>
        <p><strong>Overlap with Blacklists:</strong> Using domains
        and phone numbers from a large number of public blacklists

        resource appeared in any of the PBLs. We collected data
        from these lists beginning Jan 2014 up until April 2017,
        encompassing the AD/SR data collection period, which allows
        us to make fair comparisons. Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl"
        href="#tab5">5</a> shows the overlap with several
        blacklists. Cumulatively, these lists cover only 26.8%
        FQDNs, that were found to be involved in TSS by our system.
        Moreover, out of the 26.8% blacklisted FQDNs, 8.2% were
        already present in one of the lists when our system
        detected them, while the remaining 18.6% were detected by
        our system ∼ 26 days in advance, on average. Moreover, when
        we cross-listed the <em>support</em> domains against these
        lists, we found that &lt; 1% of those were present in any
        of these lists. This analysis suggests that while exclusive
        TSS blacklists are a good idea alongside traditional PBLs,
        there is much scope for improvement by detecting these
        domains using an automated system such as ours.</p>

        <p>The Clustering module (Section &nbsp;<a class="sec"
        href="#sec-15">2.6</a>) produces clusters consisting of
        final-landing domains that share similar network and
        application features. Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href=
        "#tab6">6</a> lists some of the major campaigns attributed
        by our system and the resources associated with them.
        First, although TSS are notoriously synonymous with
        Microsoft and its products, we found that many other brands
        are also targets of TSS campaigns. These brands include
        Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook among others. Microsoft,
        however, remains on top of the most abused brands with 4
        out of the top 5 TSS campaigns targeting Microsoft and its
        products. Second, we observed that TSS campaigns tend to
        advertise services targeted at particular brands and its
        line of products. This behavior is likely because the call
        center agents are trained to specialize in technical
        aspects associated with a particular type of
        product/service which could be a device (e.g. kindle),
        software (e.g. browser) or OS (e.g. Windows Vista) rather
        than generic technical support.</p>

      <p>In this case study, we analyze the largest TSS campaign
      from Table&nbsp;<a class="tbl" href="#tab6">6</a> to
      highlight the technique used to promote the TSS websites and
      the infrastructure used to grow and sustain the campaign over
      time. The campaign primarily targeted <tt>Bing.com</tt>
      users. It consisted of 452 support domains, 662 final-landing
      domains which mapped to 216 IPs over time and advertised 521
      unique phone numbers. The campaign was first detected on
      04/16/2016 and was active as recently as 03/30/2017. <em>SEO
      Technique</em>: The support domains use black hat SEO
      techniques sometimes referred to as <em>spamdexing</em> to
      manipulate the SRs. The support domains seen on the search
      page act as <em>doorway</em> pages to final-landing TSS
      domains. However, they use cloaking techniques such as text
      stuffing and link stuffing, consisting of technical support
      related keywords and links, to hide their real intent from
      search engine crawlers and get promoted up the SR rankings.
      It is surprising that these standard techniques still
      work.</p>
      <p><strong>IP Infrastructure Insights:</strong> We found that
      IP space used by support domains is quite different and
      decoupled from where final-landing TSS domains are located.
      Also, while the address space for fake technical support
      domains is fragmented, the entire set of support domains are
      concentrated in a single subnet, 185.38.184.0/24 as evident
      from Figure&nbsp;<a class="fig" href="#fig7">7</a>. IP to AS
      mapping for the subnet points to AS# 13213 under the name
      UK2NET-AS, GB. The ASN has country code listed as ME,
      Montenegro. The IP-Geo location data too points to an ISP in
      Montenegro, Budva. In contrast, IP's associated with
      final-landing TSS domains pointed to different AS#’s 31815,
      Media Temple, Inc, AS# 13335, Cloudflare and AS# 26496
      GO-DADDY-COM-LLC based on IP to AS mapping data. They were
      geographically located in the US based on IP-Geo data. The
      fragmentation in the hosting infrastructure for the
      final-landing TSS domains gives the technical support
      scammers a reliable way to spread their assets. The
      decoupling of the infrastructure between support domains and
      final-landing TSS domains suggests that the technical support
      scammers are using the support domains as a “service” to
      offload the work of SEO.</p>

          <h2><span class="section-number">5</span> Discussion and
          Limitations</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p><strong>Comparison with Past TSS studies:</strong></p>
      <p>In this section, we compare our results with the findings
      of a previous study&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>]. For a direct comparison, we were
      able to obtain data from Miramirkhani et al. for the period
      Jan-Mar 2017, which overlaps with the second time window of
      data collection in our work. Specifically, we received a list
      of 2,768 FQDNs discovered by their tool (2441 second-level
      domains), 882 toll-free phone numbers and 1,994 IP addresses.
      Upon intersecting these sets with our own data, we found
      0/2,768 FQDNs and 0/2,441 second-level domains that were
      common. Moreover, in terms of server and telephony
      infrastructure, we discovered that the two datasets had
      92/1,994 common IP addresses of servers hosting TSS and 5/882
      common toll-free phone numbers. We also discovered frequent
      use of “noindex”&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>] meta tags in the HTML source of
      webpages associated with domains in Miramirkhani et. al.
      dataset which was noticeably missing from webpages in our
      dataset. This indicates that TSS domains circulated via
      malvertising channels such ad-based url shorteners and
      typosquatting do not wish to be discovered by search engine
      crawlers, quite the opposite of search-and-ad TSS domains
      that are the focus of this work. Given this near-zero
      intersection of the two datasets and observations made above,
      we argue that our approach is discovering TSS infrastructure
      that ROBOVIC&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>] is unable to find. An important
      contribution of our work is focusing on “passive” TSS which
      manifest mostly as organic search results. These pages are
      unlikely to be circulated over malvertising channels: a
      benign-looking tech support page is unlikely to capture the
      attention of users who were never searching for technical
      support in the first place.</p>
      <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Like all real-world systems,
      our work is not without its limitations. Our choice of using
      PhantomJS for crawling search results and ads can, in
      principle, be detected by scammers who can use this knowledge
      to evade our monitors. We argue that replacing PhantomJS with
      a real browser is a relatively straightforward task which
      merely requires more hardware resources. Similarly, our
      choice of keeping our crawler stateless could lead to
      evasions which would again be avoided if one used a real,
      Selenium-driven, browser. Finally, while we conduct reviews
      for cluster quality, we expect to formally evaluate the
      efficacy of clustering with more ground truth data.</p>

      <p>As mentioned throughout this paper, Miramirkhani et
      al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0053">53</a>]
      performed the first analysis of technical support scams (TSS)
      by focusing on scams delivered via malvertising channels and
      interacting with scammers to identify their modus operandi.
      In recent work, Sahin et al.&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0060">60</a>] investigated the
      effectiveness of chatbots in conversing with phone scammers.
      Researchers have identified the evolving role of telephony
      and how phone numbers play a central role in a wide range of
      scams, including Nigerian scams, phishing, phone-verified
      accounts, and SMS spam&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger=

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0068">68</a>].</p>
      <p>In addition to telephony-specific work, researchers have
      analyzed a range of underground ecosystems detailing their
      infrastructure and identifying the parties involved, in
      addition to potential pressure points&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>, <a class="bib"

      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0064">64</a>]. Since TSS is a type of
      underground ecosystem, we borrowed ideas found in prior work,
      such as, the appropriate setting of <em>User Agent</em> and
      <em>Referrer</em> crawler parameters used by Leontiadis et
      al. during their analysis of drug scams&nbsp;[<a class="bib"
      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0050">50</a>] to make requests appear
      as if they originated from a real user clicking on a search
      result. Also, search-redirection based drug scams discovered
      by them rely on compromising high-reputation websites while
      the TSS scams discovered by our system rely on black hat SEO
      and malicious advertisement tactics.</p>
      <p>Finally, there have been numerous studies that cluster
      abuse/spam infrastructure and campaigns based on
      URLs&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0067">67</a>],
      IP infrastructure&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

      data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement=
      "top" href="#BibPLXBIB0037">37</a>]. Similar hierarchical
      clustering techniques too have been shown effective in
      multiple contexts&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0066">66</a>]. In terms of countermeasures, prior
      work has shown the ineffectiveness of traditional blacklists
      in protecting services, such as instant messaging
      (IM)&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle=
      "popover" data-placement="top" href="#BibPLXBIB0059">59</a>],
      and social media&nbsp;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover"
      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=

      data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" href=
      "#BibPLXBIB0067">67</a>]. Unfortunately, until blacklist
      curators adopt systems such as our own, blacklists will also
      be ineffective against TSS scams.</p>

          Conclusions</h2>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>In this paper, we analyzed TSS by focusing on two new
      sources of scams: organic search results and ads shown next
      to these results. Using carefully constructed search queries
      and network amplification techniques, we developed a system
      that was able to find thousands of active TSS. We identify
      the presence of long-lived support domains which shield the
      final scam domains from search engines and shed light on the
      SEO tactics of scammers. In addition to aggressive scams, our
      system allowed us to discover thousands of passive TSS pages
      which appear professional, and yet display phone numbers
      which lead to scammers. We showed that our system discovers
      thousands of TSS-related domains, IP addresses, and phone
      numbers that are missed by prior work, and would therefore
      offer a marked increase of protection when incorporated into
      systems generating blacklists of malicious
      infrastructure.</p>
