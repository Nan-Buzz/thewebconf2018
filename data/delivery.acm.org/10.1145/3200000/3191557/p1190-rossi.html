While metadata and textual information have taken the lion&#x0027;s share as data sources for social media analysis, geotagged image-based platforms represent an unprecedented and as yet almost untapped source of data to analyse human behaviour and characterise the physical space we live in. In this paper we investigate the use of Instagram photos to analyse tourism consumption. We take the city of Venice (Italy) as a case study and we collect a dataset of about 90k photos taken between January 2014 and December 2015. Using computer vision techniques, we build a supervised classifier which assigns each photo to one of six different categories. We then observe how the frequency and spatial distribution of these categories varies with time. This in turn allows us to confirm the existence of a number of touristic hotspots associated with different events, such as Venice Carnival and Biennale. Our analysis also uncovers the existence of touristic flows associated with these events, such as the <em>Folklore Line</em> that marks the path of tourists from &#x201C;Santa Lucia&#x201D; railway station to &#x201C;San Marco&#x201D; square during the Carnival period. Overall, our findings confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework to investigate tourism consumption using Instagram data.</small>    </p>    </div>    <div class="classifications">    <div class="author">     <span style="font-weight:bold;">      <small>Keywords:</small>     </span>     <span class="keyword">      <small>Social media analysis; Urban informatics; Instagram</small>     </span>    </div>    <br/>    <div class="AcmReferenceFormat">     <p>      <small>       <span style="font-weight:bold;">ACM Reference Format:</span>       <br/>       Luca Rossi, Eric Boscaro, and Andrea Torsello. 2018.

Italy was the 5th most popular destination worldwide in 2015<sup><a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>    </sup>, and Venice is consistently listed among the most visited cities in Italy<a class="fn" href="#fn4" id="foot-fn4"><sup>4</sup></a>. We collect 90k photos taken between January 2014 and December 2015 and we design a simple-yet-effective supervised classification framework to automatically assign them to 6 different categories. We study the temporal and spatial distribution of these categories and we find that:</p>    <ul class="list-no-style">    <li id="list1" label="&#x2022;">The number of pictures taken increases over the observed period, with local peaks around major events like Carnival, the Venice Film Festival, and the Biennale exhibitions;<br/></li>    <li id="list2" label="&#x2022;">Approximately 25% of the photos are of architectural elements such as bridges, churches, squares, highlighting the rich architectural heritage of Venice. However, the fraction of pictures in each categories varies with time, showing a clear dependency on events like art exhibitions and folklore festivals. For example, we observe a marked increase in the frequency of pictures of subjects related to Venetian folklore during the Carnival period (17%, as opposed to 14% in the period after the Carnival).<br/></li>    <li id="list3" label="&#x2022;">The spatial distribution of the photos&#x2019; categories closely reflects the function of the associated venues. For example, we find that most artworks pictures are located in well-known art venues, such as Biennale venues.<br/></li>    <li id="list4" label="&#x2022;">Pictures of Venetian masks and other objects related to Venetian folklore are mainly distributed along the <em>Folklore Line</em>, a straight path that connects Venice &#x201C;Santa Lucia&#x201D; railway station (one of the main entry points for the city of Venice) to &#x201C;San Marco&#x201D; square, passing through &#x201C;Rialto&#x201D; bridge (together with &#x201C;San Marco&#x201D; square, one of the area with the highest concentration of Venetian masks). This effect is particularly pronounced during the Carnival period.<br/></li>    </ul>    <p>To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first effort toward an automated spatio-temporal analysis of tourism using image-based social media. We believe that such a framework could find applications in several areas, from urban planning to marketing and the general tourism industry. In particular, we envision the possibility of using a similar analysis to understand tourism consumption over a certain geographical area and to support marketing campaigns as well as general tourism investments.</p>    <p>The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: &#x00A7;<a class="sec" href="#sec-5">2</a> reviews the related work, and &#x00A7;<a class="sec" href="#sec-6">3</a> describes the dataset and its collection. &#x00A7;<a class="sec" href="#sec-7">4</a> introduces and evaluates the image classification framework used in this paper, while &#x00A7;<a class="sec" href="#sec-9">5</a> and &#x00A7;<a class="sec" href="#sec-15">6</a> present the main findings and discuss the limitations of our study.

In particular, a significant amount of research has focused on the analysis of geotagged data, as this allows to draw a powerful parallel between the virtual and physical worlds. Colombo et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] looked at Foursquare activity to analyse human mobility patterns. The authors found the visits to both home and workplace are highly regular and thus easily predictable. Song et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>] explored the boundaries of predictability of human mobility, and De Domenico et al.[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] showed how integrating information on the movements of a user&#x0027;s friend can make it easier to predict the movement of the user him/herself. De Montjoye et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] and Rossi et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>], on the other hand, investigated the extent to which these datasets of geotagged activity can be used to compromise users privacy.</p>    <p>Image-based social media like Instagram and Flickr allow users to geotag and share photos with friends. In contrast to purely location-based social networks, the focus is not on the location but rather on the image being shared. This in turn provides a remarkably rich source of information to understand human behaviour in connection with the world around us. Hochman and Schwartz&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] collect Instagram photos from New York City and Tokyo and study the differences in hue and brightness between the images collected over the two cities. They identify recurring <em>visual rhythms</em> that provide insights into different cultural practices on a local and global scale. Hu et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] provide one of the first quantitative analysis of the Instagram social network. Similarly to our work, they use Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>] features and Bag-of-Words (BOW)&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>] to describe the images, and they use <em>k</em>-means to cluster them into 8 categories. With these categories to hand, they identify different type of Instagram users and they study the relation between the number of a user&#x0027;s followers and the photos he/she shares on Instagram. Souza et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>] gather a dataset of Instagram selfies, i.e., digital self-portraits, and study the characteristics of this dataset as well as the demographics of the users who post them. They confirm the increasing popularity of selfies and show that there exists a relationship between the number of selfies taken in a country and the country&#x0027;s culture of individuation and connectedness. Photos from Instagram has also been used to understand food habits around the world&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>] as well as to automatically capture the smells and colours that characterise urban environments&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>].</p>    <p>In this work we propose to use Instagram photos to characterise tourism consumption. Latorre-Mart&#x00ED;nez et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>] and Iniguez et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>] also use photos collected from both Flickr and Instagram to study tourism consumption (in Zaragoza, Spain). However their analysis only looks at geoposition indicators and hashtags, and it does not make use of the visual information provided by the images themselves. We take a complementary approach and decide to look at the content of the images, which in turn allows us to tap a much richer source of information than the hashtags alone. Our work also bears some similarities with that of Hu et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>], who also employ computer vision techniques to automatically group images into categories. In contrast to them, we take a supervised approach and we classify the images using a more sophisticated framework. This in turn allows us to define more meaningful classes as well as to measure the quality of the resulting categorisation.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-6">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">3</span> Description of the Dataset</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>&#x00A0; <figure id="fig2">     <img src="../../../../deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191557/images/www18companion-296-fig2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 2"      longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Confusion matrix for different values of the <em>M</em> parameter which controls the probability of assigning an image to the <em>Other</em> category.</span>     </div>    </figure>    </p>    <p>We retrieved a set of approximately 90k geotagged photos taken in Venice between January 2014 and December 2015 using the Instagram API<a class="fn" href="#fn5" id="foot-fn5"><sup>5</sup></a>. We made use of the <em>Media Search</em> endpoint, which allowed us to search a circular area on a certain date by specifying a pair of latitude/longitude coordinates, a radius, and a date. More specifically, we called this method on a grid of coordinates to maximise the coverage of the rectangular area corresponding to the geographical zone of Venice while minimising the overlap. An alternative solution would have been to select a single circular area with a radius large enough to contain all the city of Venice, however this solution was rejected because of the API limitation on the maximum number of results per request. Each query to the <em>Media Search</em> endpoint returns a JSON file containing, among other attributes: 1) the univocal ID of the image, 2) the url of the image, which we use to retrieve the actual image, 3) latitude and longitude of picture, and 4) tags, comments and other information. Note that the Instagram API has changed since the 1st of June 2016<a class="fn" href="#fn6" id="foot-fn6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Among other things, the update introduced a number of important restrictions and limitation to the <em>Media Search</em> endpoint.</p>    <p>The photos retrieved through the Instagram API can be very different from each other, with variations in the subject, scale, orientation, and luminance. For the purpose of this study, we decide to group the images into 6 categories: 1) <em>Lagoon</em>, 2) <em>Townscape</em>, 3) <em>Art</em>, 4) <em>Folklore</em>, 5) <em>Food</em>, and 6) <em>Other</em>. Fig.&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig1">1</a> shows a sample of images from each of these categories. The <em>Lagoon</em> category is composed of photos taken near or inside the lagoon, which are characterised by the presence of water, typically in the bottom part of the image, as well as other objects, such as boats. The <em>Townscape</em> category includes photos taken in the city of Venice, and it is characterised by the presence of architectural elements such as bridges, churches, squares. The <em>Art</em> category is composed of photos taken inside museums and art galleries, while photos belonging to the <em>Folklore</em> category are related to Carnival events or Venetial folklore elements, e.g., Venetian masks. The <em>Food</em> category includes photos of dishes and drinks. Finally, the <em>Other</em> category includes all those images that do not fit in any other previous categories. The manual annotation of 90k images would be a very time consuming task. Therefore, in this study we propose to use a simple-yet-effective framework to automatically annotate our dataset given a training set of manually annotated images.</p>    <p>It should be noted that these 6 categories where chosen as they capture well known landmarks of Venice (e.g., <em>Lagoon</em>). Similarly, the <em>Folklore</em> category was chosen as we expected this to become particularly relevant during the Carnival period. To conduct a similar study on a different city, potentially different categories tailored to the geographical area and period being studied would have to be chosen first. A possible way to select these categories could be to use tags or other textual descriptors associated to the images. However, the methodology underpinning this study would remain essentially the same. Finally, an alternative unsupervised approach could be to extract a number of categories by clustering the images, however the resulting categories would still need to be validated to select the most relevant ones. <figure id="fig3">     <img src="../../../../deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191557/images/www18companion-296-fig3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 3"      longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 3:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Two examples of misclassified photos.

We use a version of the dense SIFT algorithm&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>] implemented in the VLFeat library&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0022">22</a>] to extract a set of keypoints for each image in the dataset. A SIFT keypoint is a circular region of the image with an associated feature vector which describes the local patch appearance. While being fast to compute, SIFT features are designed to provide invariance to image translation, scaling, and rotation, as well as partial invariance to illumination changes and robustness to local geometric distortions.</p>    <p>With these feature vectors to hand, we use <em>k</em>-means to cluster them and extract a set of codewords that form the dictionary of our BOW representation&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>]. Given an image with an associated set of SIFT features and a dictionary of codewords, we assign each feature to the closest codeword, allowing us to represent the original image as an histogram over the codewords. <figure id="fig4">     <img src="../../../../deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191557/images/www18companion-296-fig4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 4"      longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 4:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Histograms of the number of photos taken for each category in 2014 and 2015 (a), line plot showing the growth of the total number of photos taken in 2014 and 2015 (b), and line plot showing the fraction of photos in the <em>Art</em> category over 2015 (c). In (c), the shaded circular and rectangular areas highlight the period in which Carnival and the Biennale take place, respectively.</span>     </div>    </figure>    </p>    <p>For a set of labelled images, the corresponding histograms are used to train a set of one-vs-one Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>]. Recall that in the one-vs-one approach we need to train a set of binary classifiers, one for each pair of classes. Each classifier then votes for one of two classes, and the final class label is assigned by (weighted) majority voting. An alternative approach would have been to use a one-vs-all approach, where for each class we define a single classifier, with the samples of that class positive samples and the sample from all the other classes as negatives samples. In this paper, we opt for the one-vs-one approach as this allows for more flexibility in the decision boundary between classes.</p>    <p>With this framework to hand, given an unlabelled image, its BOW representation is passed to the SVM classifiers. The output is a probability distribution over the classes&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>], and the category with the maximum probability is finally used to label the original image.</p>    <section id="sec-8">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">4.1</span> Image Classifier Evaluation</h3>     </div>    </header>    <p>In order to train the classifier, we manually label 100 images for each of the 6 classes, for a total of 600 images. With this set to hand, the performance of the classifier is evaluated using 5-fold cross validation. Fig.&#x00A0;2(a) shows the resulting confusion matrix. The average classification accuracy is 68% and the f-measure is 68%. However, while for the first 5 classes the number of misclassified images is low, in the case of the <em>Other</em> class this numbers increases sharply, with over 50% of the photos belonging to this class being misclassified as belonging to another category. This is an important issue, as we expect a large number of images in our dataset to belong to this class. In fact, in our dataset <em>Other</em> is essentially a placeholder for anything that does not belong to the 5 classes we are interested in.</p>    <p>To address this problem, we decide to multiply the probability of an image being assigned to <em>Other</em> by a parameter <em>M</em>, optimised through 5-fold cross validation on the training set. Fig.&#x00A0;2(b) shows the confusion matrix for the optimal value <em>M</em> = 2. The corresponding average accuracy is 69% and the f-measure is 70%. Note that the number of false positives for the first 5 classes is drastically reduced, while the number of false positives for <em>Other</em> is significantly increased. Since the main classes we are interested in are the first 5 classes, we aim to keep the number of false positives for these classes as low as possible. Therefore, we use the classifier with <em>M</em> = 2 to assign the labels to the rest of the images in the dataset.</p>    <p>Fig.&#x00A0;<a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a> shows two examples of incorrectly classified images. Fig.&#x00A0;3(a) shows an image of gondolas that belongs to the <em>Folklore</em> category but has been incorrectly classified as <em>Townscape</em>. This is particularly a challenging image, which could be easily classified by a human as belonging to either category, as well as the <em>Lagoon</em>. The classifier assigns the highest probability (0.37) to the <em>Townscape</em> class, while the second highest probability is assigned to the <em>Folklore</em> class (0.33). Fig.&#x00A0;3(b), on the other hand, shows an image that belongs to the <em>Townscape</em> category but has been incorrectly classified as <em>Other</em>. In this case, the error is due to the <em>M</em> correction, which artificially increases the probability of assigning the image to the class <em>Other</em> from 0.23 to 0.46. The second most probable class is indeed <em>Townscape</em> (0.35). Note that without this correction the image would have been classified correctly. <figure id="fig5">      <img src="../../../../deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191557/images/www18companion-296-fig5.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 5"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 5:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Geographical distribution of the photos in the <em>Lagoon</em> (a,b) and <em>Townscape</em> (c,d) categories.

Note that in the remainder of the paper we will not consider the images belonging to this category.

This is in line with the worldwide growth in Instagram active users, which have more than doubled from the beginning of 2014 to the end of 2015<a class="fn" href="#fn7" id="foot-fn7"><sup>7</sup></a>.

The circular shaded area shows the Carnival period, while the rectangular shaded area highlights the months during which the 56th &#x201C;Art Biennale&#x201D; exhibitions took place (from the 9th May to the 22nd November 2015). We observe a clear increase in the percentage of images belonging to the <em>Art</em> category. Note that this is not influenced by the increase of Instagram users observed during the same period, as here we measured the fraction rather than the absolute number of <em>Art</em> images. While the increase of <em>Art</em> pictures during the &#x201C;Art Biennale&#x201D; does not come as a surprise, we argue that the relative increase of the rate of <em>Art</em> pictures during Carnival is due to the large number of cultural events that are organized in museums and art galleries during this period.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-11">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">5.2</span> Geospatial Analysis</h3>     </div>    </header>    <p>We now focus on the spatial distribution of the data.

As expected, the majority of pictures belonging to this class is found near waterways, both canals (e.g., &#x201C;Grand Canal&#x201D; and &#x201C;Giudecca Canal&#x201D;) and the lagoon (e.g., &#x201C;San Marco&#x201D; and &#x201C;Giudecca&#x201D;). Similarly, we expect photos in the <em>Townscape</em> category to be distributed all over the urban area, with the highest density points being located near the most touristic spots, e.g., &#x201C;Rialto&#x201D; and &#x201C;San Marco&#x201D;. Figs.&#x00A0;5(c) and &#x00A0;5(d), where the highest density of photos is shown to be over the central area of Venice, supports this intuition.</p>     <p>These findings provide a strong qualitative validation of the correctness of the image classifier, which further supports the quantitative evaluation of the previous sections.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-13">     <p><em>5.2.2 Art, Folklore, and Food Heatmaps.</em> The Biennale Foundation, based in Venice, is one of the most prominent cultural organizations in the world. It is responsible for organising, among other events, the &#x201C;Art Biennale&#x201D; (in odd-numbered years), the &#x201C;Venice Biennale of Architecture&#x201D; (in even-numbered years), and the &#x201C;Venice Film Festival&#x201D; (annually)<a class="fn" href="#fn8" id="foot-fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the buildings where these events take place are among the hotspots of the <em>Art</em> heatmap (see Figs.&#x00A0;6(a) and&#x00A0;6(b)). Other notable areas of high density include the &#x201C;Venetian Arsenal&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Guggenheim Museum&#x201D;. In addition to these locations, the higher volume of data recorded for 2015 allow us to retrieve more areas characterised by a high activity in the <em>Art</em> category, including &#x201C;Palazzo Grassi&#x201D; (a famous art gallery overlooking the Grand Canal<a class="fn" href="#fn9" id="foot-fn9"><sup>9</sup></a>) and &#x201C;San Giorgio Maggiore&#x201D; (a 16th century church designed by the Italian architect Andrea Palladio, where several paintings of Jacopo Tintoretto can be found<a class="fn" href="#fn10" id="foot-fn10"><sup>10</sup></a>).</p>     <p>For the <em>Folklore</em> category, both Fig.&#x00A0;6(c) and Fig.&#x00A0;6(d) show a high concentration of photos taken in the most central and touristic areas of Venice. More interestingly, these hotspots seem to be aligned along the shortest path connecting Venice &#x201C;Santa Lucia&#x201D; railway station and &#x201C;San Marco&#x201D; square, passing through &#x201C;Campo San Polo&#x201D;, &#x201C;Campo San Silvestro&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Rialto&#x201D;. This suggests the existence of a preferred route for tourists visiting Venice during folklore related events, such as Carnival. We call this the <em>Folklore Line</em>. Indeed, during Carnival most masks are found in the &#x201C;Rialto&#x201D; and &#x201C;San Marco&#x201D; areas, and the shortest path to these places from the bus and train stations (the main points of entry to Venice) coincides with the <em>Folklore Line</em>. Our analysis also shows that the &#x201C;San Marco&#x201D; area has the highest rate of <em>Folklore</em> pictures throughout most of the year, with over 19% of the pictures taken in this area during Carnival 2014, the second most popular areas being &#x201C;San Polo&#x201D; (which is connected to &#x201C;San Marco&#x201D; by the &#x201C;Rialto&#x201D; bridge), where approximately 14% of the <em>Folklore</em> pictures are taken.</p>     <p>The last category we consider is <em>Food</em>. The heatmaps for the 2014 and 2015 data are shown in Figs.&#x00A0;6(e) and&#x00A0;6(f), respectively. While at first the interpretation of these plots may appear less clear, a closer inspection shows that the locations with the highest density of pictures correspond to well-known gastronomical venues. Notable examples include &#x201C;Al Timon&#x201D;, &#x201C;Tonolo&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Al Paradiso Perduto&#x201D;. It is also interesting to note that some areas with a remarkable presence of notable restaurants are not discovered though our analysis. We argue that this is due to their position, being outside the main touristic routes.</p>    </section>    </section>    <section id="sec-14">    <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">5.3</span> A Case Study: Venice Carnival 2015</h3>     </div>    </header>    <figure id="fig7">     <img src="../../../../deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191557/images/www18companion-296-fig7.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 7"      longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 7:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Geographical distribution of the photos in the <em>Folklore</em> category during the Carnival period (a) and after it (b).

As expected, during the Carnival period the frequency of <em>Folklore</em> pictures (17%) is significantly higher than during March (14%). Similarly, the <em>Folklore</em> category is the second most commonly photographed category during Carnival, but it drops to being the 4th most photographed one after Carnival.

The ability to geotag this type of data opens up even more possibilities of analysis. This richness, however, comes at the cost of an increased difficulty in interpreting the content of an image as opposed to a string of text or a list of keywords. Here we have proposed a simple-yet-effective computer vision pipeline to analyse images shared on Instagram and assign them to a set of predefined categories. While there exist more accurate techniques for classifying images(e.g., &#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>]), we believe that the proposed framework provides a good trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. We should also stress, however, that while the experimental results have highlighted the quality of the classifier and the ability of the overall framework to reveal cultural and food hotspots, our study presents a number of important limitations.</p>    <p>For example, we have seen that in some cases the classifier is unable to reach a clear consensus on the class membership of some pictures (see Fig.&#x00A0;3(b)). Our approach, in these cases, is to assign the image to <em>Other</em>. While this ensures that an image assigned to another category is unlikely to have been misclassified, this means also that some images are wrongly assigned to the <em>Other</em> class, thus reducing the amount of data that we can analyse. One way to overcome this problem may be to integrate hashtags and other textual attributes in the classification process when the class membership is unclear.</p>    <p>In some cases, however, an image may actually belong to more than one category (see Fig.&#x00A0;3(a)). This could be addressed by extending the proposed classifier to handle multi-label categorisation&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0021">21</a>]. A relatively straightforward solution would be to use off-the-shelf software libraries like the one used in this paper <a class="fn" href="#fn11" id="foot-fn11"><sup>11</sup></a>. However note that this would require relabeling the entire training set assigning multiple labels to each image.</p>    <p>The results of our work could have applications in a number of areas, from urban planning to marketing and advertisement campaigns. One possibility would be to use this framework to guide the development of urban areas and in particular the allocation of investments to boost and support tourism. Neighbourhoods in need of development could be identified by looking at the digital traces left by tourists on platforms like Instagram or Flickr. This would be particularly interesting if augmented with semantic information from tags or other metadata that captures the perceived attractiveness of a place. One can also envision a system that creates a personalised tourist guide by linking the representation of a city given by our framework to the preferences of a user, similarly to what proposed by Quercia et al.&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. The preferences of a user could be determined from his/her shared photos, and itineraries over a certain area that match his/her preferences could be suggested by looking at aggregated data collected over that same area from other users.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-16">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">7</span> Conclusion and Future Work</h2>    </div>    </header>    <p>In this paper we explored tourism consumption through the lens of social media. We have collected a dataset of 90k Instagram photos taken in the city of Venice between January 2014 and December 2015. We have designed a simple-yet-effective supervised classification framework to automatically assign each image to one of six predefined categories.</p>    <p>Our analysis highlighted the presence of a number of touristic hotspots, associated with popular cultural as well as gastronomical venues. We have observed that this signal is influenced by a number of external events, such as folklore and art festivals. Interestingly, we have found that the spatial distribution of the photos can reveal the presence of preferred touristic routes during some events, as in the case of the <em>Folklore Line</em> during the Carnival period.</p>    <p>An obvious extension of this work would be to improve the classifier, for example by replacing SIFT features with those extracted by a Convolutional Neural Network. Particularly interesting would be to consider also the textual information associated with a picture, e.g., the descriptions, comments, and tags. This in turn would allow us to design a more robust classifier. More interestingly, one could use natural language processing techniques to understand the mood associated with a certain picture, adding an additional layer of analysis.</p>   </section>  </section>  <section class="back-matter">   <section id="ref-001">    <header>    <div class="title-info">     <h2 class="page-brake-head">REFERENCES</h2>    </div>    </header>    <ul class="bibUl">    <li id="BibPLXBIB0001" label="[1]">Gualtiero&#x00A0;B Colombo, Matthew&#x00A0;J Chorley, Matthew&#x00A0;J Williams, Stuart&#x00A0;M Allen, and Roger&#x00A0;M Whitaker. 2012.
