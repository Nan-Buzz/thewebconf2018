Indeed, there are two sources of data that can be used to perform the community detection task. The first one is the data about the nodes and their attributes and the second source of data comes from the different kind of connections among vertices. For example, in social networks, edge attributes represents the relationship (friendship, collaboration, family, etc) among people while vertex attribute describe the role or the personality of a person. An other example, is the bibliographical network, a vertex may represent an author and vertex properties describe attributes or features of the author as the area of interest, the number of publications, while the topological structure represent relationships among authors.</p>    <p>Thus, it is important to consider both sources of information simultaneously and consider network communities as sets of nodes that are densely connected, but which also share some common attributes. Node attributes can complement the network structure, leading to more precise detection of communities; additionally, if one source of information is missing or is noisy, the other will be used. However, considering both node attributes and network topology for community detection is also challenging, as the approach have to combine two types of information [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>].

On the other hand, the well-known graph clustering techniques, as clustering based on normalized cut [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0026">26</a>], modularity [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0023">23</a>] use the relationships of the network to partition the graph into several densely connected components, but do not use the properties of the nodes. The problem is to apply clustering approaches that use graph data and attribute data simultaneously in order to detect clusters that are densely connected in the graph and at the same time to use the similarity in the attribute space. Few recent studies have addressed the problem of clustering in attributed networks.</p>    <p>Community detection in attributed networks identify clusters either in the full space of the network or in multiple sub-spaces [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>] [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0013">13</a>].

Node&#x0027;s attribute are used as <em>additional</em> topological information. It will be used to change the initial topology structure of the input graph. Next, we present different ways to consider the node&#x0027;s attribute information.</p>     <section id="sec-8">     <p><em>2.1.1 Edge weighting based approaches.</em> In order to integrate the attribute information in the clustering process, these methods define a similarity measure between node attributes that will be used to weight the existing edges. The similarity between nodes is determined by examining each of <em>T</em> attribute values they have in common. Then any unsupervised clustering algorithm for weighted graphs can be applied. The values of weights will influence the clustering algorithm to privilege the creation of groups in which the nodes are not only well connected but also similar. Algorithm 1 shows the principal outlines of this approach.</p>     <p>      <img src="../../../../deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191570/images/www18companion-309-img1.svg" class="img-responsive" alt=""       longdesc=""/>     </p>     <p>We report in the following the main works adopting this strategy. In [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>], authors propose the <em>matching coefficient</em> similarity function that consists on counting, for two connected vertices, the number of attribute values they have in common. Formally, the <em>matching coefficient</em> over two vertices (<em>u</em>, <em>v</em>) is given by : <div class="table-responsive" id="Xeq1">       <div class="display-equation">        <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation} \mathcal {S}(u,v) = \bigg \lbrace \begin{array}{ll}\sum _{t = 1}^T s_{a_t}(u,v) &#x0026;if(u,v)\in E \quad or \quad (v,u) \in E \\ 0 \quad &#x0026; otherwise \end{array} \end{equation} </span>        <br/>        <span class="equation-number">(1)</span>       </div>      </div> Where <div class="table-responsive">       <div class="display-equation">        <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation*} s_{a_t}(u,v) = \bigg \lbrace \begin{array}{ll}1 &#x0026; if f_{t}(u) = f_{t}(v) \\ 0 \quad &#x0026; otherwise \end{array}\end{equation*} </span>        <br/>       </div>      </div>     </p>     <p>Once the weights are changed, the authors use a classical unsupervised learning algorithm as Karger&#x0027;s Min-Cut [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>], spectral clustering [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0029">29</a>] on the weighted adjacency matrix. Community detection algorithm that deals with weighted graph as Louvain [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] can also be used. Initially, the <em>matching coefficient</em> similarity measure deals only with categorical attribute. It was extended by [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0027">27</a>] to handle, at the same time, categorical and continuous attributes. For continuous attributes, first each attribute is normalized to the range of [0, 1] by adding a normalizing parameter denoted <em>&#x03B1;</em> and then, the arithmetic difference between the pairs of attribute value is used to obtain a similarity score. This similarity metric is expressed as : <div class="table-responsive">       <div class="display-equation">        <span class="tex mytex">\begin{equation*} s^{\prime }_{a_t}(u,v) = \bigg \lbrace \begin{array}{l}1 \quad if \quad a_t \quad categorical \quad \&#x0026; \quad f_t(u)=f_t(v)\\ 1- \alpha _t|f_t(u)=f_t(v)| \quad if\quad a_t \quad continuous \\ 0 \quad otherwise \end{array}\end{equation*} </span>        <br/>       </div>      </div> Where <em>&#x03B1;<sub>t</sub>      </em> is a normalizing parameter that corresponds to the attribute <em>a<sub>t</sub>      </em>. It allows to normalize the attribute value of <em>a<sub>t</sub>      </em> in the range of [0, 1]. Edge weighting based approaches produces a new edge weights according to node attribute similarity. If the original graph is weighted, the two weight can be merged. This family of techniques are simple to implement but their disadvantage is that they take in consideration only vertices that are directly connected. Vertices that are not directly connected in the graph have a similarity equal to zero regardless to their attribute value.</p>     </section>     <section id="sec-9">     <p><em>2.1.2 Augmented graph based approaches.</em> This kind of approaches seeks to combine the topological structure and the attribute information through an augmented graph. The initial topological structure of the original graph is augmented by new vertices called <em>attribute vertices</em> and new edges called <em>attribute edges</em>. An <em>attribute vertex</em>      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$v_{a_{ti}}$</span>      </span> represents an attribute-value pair (<em>a<sub>t</sub>      </em>, <em>a<sub>ti</sub>      </em>) where <em>a<sub>ti</sub>      </em> &#x2208; <em>dom</em>(<em>a<sub>t</sub>      </em>) is a value of the attribute <em>a<sub>t</sub>      </em>. If a vertex <em>v</em> has the value <em>a<sub>ti</sub>      </em> on the attribute <em>a<sub>t</sub>      </em>, an <em>attribute edge</em> is added between the vertex <em>v</em> and the <em>attribute vertex</em>      <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$v_{a_{ti}}$</span>      </span>. With such graph augmentation, the attribute similarity is expressed as vertex neighborhood in the augmented graph: two vertices which share the same attribute value are connected by a common <em>attribute vertex</em>. Since each vertex <em>v<sub>i</sub>      </em> has <em>T</em> attribute values, there are totally <span class="inline-equation"><span class="tex">$|\mathcal {V}| \times T$</span>      </span> attribute edges added to the original graph. In the augmented graph, two vertices are close if they are connected through many other original vertices, or if they share many common <em>attribute vertices</em> as neighbors. Once the augmented graph is created, distance measure which estimate the pairwise vertex closeness or a community detection algorithm can be applied to find out the set of clusters. Next, in algorithm 2, we present in a formal way the principle of attributed network algorithm based on augmented graph.</p>     <p>      <img src="../../../../deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191570/images/www18companion-309-img2.svg" class="img-responsive" alt=""       longdesc=""/>     </p>     <p>Authors in [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>], [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>] propose SA-Cluster algorithm that use the neighborhood random walk distance to compute a unified distance between vertices on the augmented graph. The random walk distance between two vertices is based on the paths consisting of both structure and attribute edges. In this way, it combines the structural closeness and attribute similarity through the random walk distance measure. Then, the random walk distance is used as pairwise similarity measure in the clustering process by K-Medoids clustering approach to partition the graph into <em>k</em> clusters. Approaches based on augmented graph can handle only categorical attribute but it can be easily extended to handle both categorical and continuous attribute.

Generally this distance is defined as a linear combination between a structural distance function and node attribute distance.

For instance, social networks often exhibit dense regions and follow power-law degree distribution. The higher value for <em>&#x03B1;</em> seems effective for these networks because nodes in dense regions are expected to have similar attributes.

The position of each vertex in the graph will be characterized by its relations with the seed nodes. Once <em>seeds</em> are selected, topological feature i.e. distance will be used to characterize the relation between <em>seeds</em> and all nodes of the network. Then, using a weighting factor, merge topological structure features and attribute information. Encapsulating topological information in attributes enriches the dimension space.

The probabilistic model essentially defines a joint probability distribution over the space of all possible clustering and all possible attributed graphs. For a given attributed graph to be clustered, the model assigns a probability for each possible clustering of the vertices. The cluster label of each vertex is represented as a hidden variable. The model enforces the intra-cluster similarity by asserting that the attribute values and edge connections of a vertex should depend on its cluster label. In particular, attribute values and edge connections for vertices within the same cluster should follow a common distributions that are specific to that cluster. BAGC starts with a random assignment of the vertices into clusters. Then, the parameters of all the distributions are iteratively recalculated.

We added also to <em>k</em> the number of communities found by algorithms that don&#x0027;t need the number of cluster as input in order to compare with it.</p>     <p>The experimental results of the methods on <em>DBLP10k</em> and <em>Emails</em> are shown in Figure <a class="fig" href="#fig3">3</a>, <a class="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>, <a class="fig" href="#fig5">5</a> and <a class="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>.</p>     <p>The best methods should preserve the dense connectivity among vertices in the original graph and low entropy values simultaneously. Density, conductance and modularity measures the connectivity around vertices. For ANCA these topological quality measures are correlated and they decrease when <em>k</em> increase. The density values show that the clusters found by SA-Cluster are more dense that then those found by ANCA. However, the modularity and the conductance values by SA-Cluster gives an opposite view. By analyzing at the clusters distribution, SA-Cluster find a large cluster and few vertices in other clusters. From the data in Figure, we have concluded that adding vertices attribute promotes the performance of community detection in most cases. Taking the results of ANCA as an example, most of the result were better than those of the basic Louvain Algorithm on topological structure and <em>k</em>-means on nodes attribute.</p>    </section>   </section>   <section id="sec-20">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">4</span> Conclusion</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>In this paper we provide an overview of the emerging topic of clustering in attributed graph. Only few works have been proposed in the literature and their aim is to partition attributed graphs into dense clusters with vertices having similar attributes. The existing methods can be differentiate into three main approaches based on the manner in which the topological and attribute data are considered. We then compare a set of community detection algorithm in attributed network on both artificial data and real world data.</p>   </section>  </section>  <section class="back-matter">   <section id="ref-001">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2 class="page-brake-head">REFERENCES</h2>     </div>    </header>    <ul class="bibUl">     <li id="BibPLXBIB0001" label="[1]">Martin Atzmueller. 2015.
