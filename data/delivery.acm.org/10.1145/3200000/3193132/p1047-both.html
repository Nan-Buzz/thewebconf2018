However, there is still an obvious gap between the claim of providing access to any &#x2013; structured or unstructured &#x2013; knowledge stored in the world using an interface fitting the demands of regular users. On the one hand side, implementing Question Answering Systems is still hard and time-consuming, on the other hand side, the QA community is still struggling on defining a common ground for collaboration across research fields regarding, for example, realistic benchmarks, maintainability, and broad coverage of knowledge sources.</small>    </p>    <p>     <small>In the talk, challenges of Question Answering will be highlight w.r.t. hybrid QA, domain-specific QA, cross knowledge base QA, etc. Particularly the industry perspective is also presented while aiming at a Question Answering platform which can be assembled from industry components as well as components of the research community. First steps towards this long-term vision are provided by the Qanary framework and similar frameworks aiming at a collaborative approach for the development QA systems which should lead to effective implementations, improved research results as well as a platform economy for QA. Such a platform would lead industry to a tighter collaboration while academics would have the opportunity of accessing precious data for further improvements.</small>    </p>    </div>    <div class="classifications">    <div class="AcmReferenceFormat">     <p>      <small>       <span style="font-weight:bold;">ACM Reference Format:</span>       <br/>       Andreas Both. 2018.
