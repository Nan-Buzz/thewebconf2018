Such activities support the wider research community but are rarely acknowledged by it. Peer-reviewing is an example of such activity when researchers spend extra time out of their busy work schedules, to read and review the scientific work of other researchers. They take the responsibility for having suitable knowledge of the presented research and assessing its scientific quality. Researchers&#x2019; activities are neither acknowledged publicly nor incentivized. Adding peer-reviewing efforts to a CV is a coarse measure that does not take into account review quality and only benefits junior researchers.</p>    <p>To recognize, acknowledge and incentivize the efforts of researchers, we present the idea of <em>ScienceMiles</em>, a crypto-currency for incentivizing peer-reviewing. Researchers would earn <em>ScienceMiles</em> every time they review a research object and would then be able to spend them, either by offering them as <em>bounty</em> to other researchers to incentivize reviews of their own research objects or exchange them for perks in conferences and journals they attend, e.g., a discount on registration (in a similar style to frequent flyer miles). A Distributed Ledger serves a two-fold purpose in this scenario: first, it provides a decentralized way of executing <em>ScienceMiles</em> transactions; second, it makes reviews both immutable and tamper-free.</p>    <p>In combination with an Open Review Process, this would foster healthy criticism, scrutiny and quality control of peer-reviews. This model would encourage researchers to submit their thorough and constructive reviews in a timely fashion. This platform would be an attempt to make peer-reviewers&#x2019; contributions quantifiable in a trustworthy fashion. Rewarding researchers for their reviews would encourage peer-reviewers to write constructive, fair, useful and unbiased reviews.</p>    <p>The remainder of the paper is structured as follow: Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-8">2</a> provides a literature review on peer-review patterns and incentives. Section <a class="sec" href="#sec-13">3</a> provides an overview of the <em>ScienceMiles</em> System.

Hauser [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] suggests that a reviewer who submits reviews after the deadline should be punished and their next publications (as a first author, in the same journal) would be delayed by twice the length of their delay. Researchers submitting their reviews before the deadline would be rewarded by journals as their manuscripts would be sent for reviews as soon as they are received and pushing them high up in the publication queue if accepted. Hauser further suggests, if habitual late-reviewers stick to their habit, another week delay should be added as a top-up. This model was proposed to fix what Hauser calls the <em>broken</em> review process where wrongdoers are not punished by editors [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>].</p>     <p>Gropp [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>] asked if peer-review is properly incentivized, and if peer-reviewers are being asked to evaluate the right things? Gropp suggested an incentive model to filter out the good peer-reviewers (e.g., timely, responsive and thorough) and then put their names into a research funds lottery.</p>     <p>     <em>TheWinnower</em> is a platform that publishes post-publication peer-reviews and is exploring incentivizing peer-reviewers to highlight their work by elevating the review report to the level of an original research publication [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]. TheWinnower platform is intended to be integrated with the Zenodo<a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="foot-fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> repository that holds Open Science publications[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>].</p>     <p>     <em>ReviewerCredits</em><a class="fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> came up with an idea to give credit to peer-reviewers. Peer-reviewers would have to contact <em>ReviewerCredits</em> which would contact the journal concerned for verification. After receiving verification, a peer-reviewer&#x0027;s profile is credited with <em>ReviewerCredits</em>. This, however, is a manual and centralized approach to add reputation to the peer-reviewers&#x2019; profile, where <em>ReviewerCredits</em> acts as a trusted third-party.</p>     <p>Existing approaches to incentivize peer-reviewers are based on centralized and manual systems requiring trust in third parties. Apart from the idea of a lottery fund for researchers, these models offer no real-world value incentives.</p>     <p>We present a model based on blockchain that would reward peer-reviewers and authors for submitting high-quality reviews. The immutability of the distributed ledgers would not allow abuse of the system or alteration of the record data in the database.

The already developed peer-reviewing systems are centralized and controlled by the publishing organizations.

The management of the conference typically sends that article to peers familiar with that area of research. Peers then examine that article and write their recommendations for the work presented in that article, along with the opinions on it, suggested improvements, and recommendations as to whether to accept or reject the article for publication.</p>    <p>Written peer-reviews and decisions are then made public by the conference so that researchers can comment on and criticize the reviews. A certain number of <em>ScienceMiles</em> would be given to the peer-reviewer for submitting a review. Their share would be increased by ratings for the constructiveness of their review. Similarly, someone who criticizes or comments on reviews would also be incentivized for their contribution. This gamification would encourage readers to reflect on and evaluate both their own reviews and those of others, and pave the path for increased dialogue to be explored.</p>    <section id="sec-14">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">3.1</span> Peer-review system on <em>Blockchain</em>      </h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>By deploying an Open Review system on blockchain, we can enrich the current methods of peer-reviewing with the benefits of blockchain. In this section, we list the benefits of building an Open Review system on top of blockchain.</p>     <ul class="list-no-style">     <li id="list12" label="&#x2022;"><strong>Recognition</strong> - Reviewers will be recognized based on their publicly available peer-reviews. With the implementation of Open Reviews on the Blockchain, the recognition and reward would be permanent and immutable. Researchers would have their public profile showing statistical analysis of their peer-reviews and rewards. These <em>ScienceMiles</em> are the acknowledgement by the research community, for contributions to the research community.<br/></li>     <li id="list13" label="&#x2022;"><strong>Activities for research community</strong> - By participating in the public platforms, authors, peer-reviewers and commentators will be entitled to be awarded <em>ScienceMiles</em>. The best peer-reviewers of the year per conference can also be awarded to researchers using <em>ScienceMiles</em>. The system will keep the record of <em>ScienceMiles</em> awarded to a peer-reviewer and the number of miles they spend.<br/></li>     <li id="list14" label="&#x2022;"><strong>Preventing abuse</strong> - Publication records are valuable for academic careers, which can induce reasons for people to game the system. The availability of incentives may increase the motivation to do so. This model can help in preventing possible abuse of authority over a peer-reviews database by making use of the openness of the system and immutability of data provided by blockchains.<br/></li>     <li id="list15" label="&#x2022;"><strong>Less bias</strong> - Peer-reviews and comments about them are publicly available as well as immutable, so reviewers are incentivised to come up with a valid and clear stance about the article, thus reducing the bias in the peer-reviewing process if any.<br/></li>     <li id="list16" label="&#x2022;"><strong>Selection</strong> - All journals maintain a database of peer-reviewers and their history [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"       href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. Blockchain offers a distinct feature of data distribution, that data is spread across the network, and thus the database of peer-reviewers is shared with everyone in the network. With the process of Open Reviews, and incentives in the form of <em>ScienceMiles</em>, editors can easily filter out the most competent peer-reviewers for future events. This filtration will be carried out on genuine unchangeable data available to everyone in the network.<br/></li>     <li id="list17" label="&#x2022;"><strong>More discussion - More knowledge</strong> - The gamification of earning <em>ScienceMiles</em> will encourage researchers and communities to participate more in discussions around peer-reviews. Researchers will have increased motivation to contribute to peer-reviewing activity, which will enrich the on-going discussions and ideas about the quality of research and peer-review.<br/></li>     </ul>     <p>Initially, consortium members would create accounts for workshops, conferences and journals designated for minting the coins (ScienceMiles) on blockchain. The management of these accounts and their allowed operations need to be investigated and outlined.</p>     <p>Collectively, these benefits promote timely, unbiased and well-thought-out peer-reviews, which will therefore improve the overall quality of scientific output. <figure id="fig1">      <img src="../../../../deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191556/images/www18companion-295-fig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 1"       longdesc=""/>      <div class="figure-caption">       <span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span>       <span class="figure-title">Peer-Reviewers Recognition System</span>      </div>     </figure>     </p>    </section>   </section>   <section id="sec-15">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">4</span> Challenges</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>In this section we are going to focus on the impacts this system would have on the peer-reviewing process.</p>    <section id="sec-16">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">4.1</span> Communal impact and acceptability</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>With the emergence of Blockchain and hundreds of multiple crypto-currencies, many people still have no idea about how digital currencies work. It will be an interesting study to observe researchers&#x2019; interest in the acceptability and usage of <em>ScienceMiles</em>. Further development and deployment of the <em>ScienceMiles</em> approach would enable the study of the reaction of researchers to a crypto-currency dedicated for scholarly purposes. Would this play an influential role in motivating researchers in their approach to peer-review? The public profiles would have their peer-reviews and number of <em>ScienceMiles</em> aggregated through their peer-reviewing activity. Would having peer-reviews and number of <em>ScienceMiles</em> on researchers&#x2019; public profiles be helpful in portraying community contributions alongside scientific publications?</p>     <p>Another benefit of peer-review data being published on a Blockchain platform would be to enable the study of further deep research questions of peer-review statistics about conferences, publishing organizations, institutions and individual researchers.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-17">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">4.2</span> Open and closed reviews</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>The design and implementation would demand further investigation into the impacts of openness and closedness of peer-reviews.

However, many people are unaware of digital currencies. There are deep practical and ideological issues to be addressed while trading currencies on external platforms, as explained by Sharples [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>]. We would have to come up with a function of equivalence between <em>ScienceMiles</em> and items of real-world value. Similarly, we would have to consider the precise levels of reward for various community activities, such as submitting a review or commenting or rating on a review.</p>     <p>Another interesting challenge would be to come up with a list of possible rewards other than paying for the conference fee and priority queue at conference venue.</p>     <p>As this model suggests a bounty program for peer-reviewers, it would be an insightful question to explore that how such bounty transfer would impact on peer-reviewers when they receive the crypto-currency but their reputations are not incremented.</p>     <p>A further question relates to the process of minting new ScienceMiles. In crypto-currencies like Bitcoin, they are minted as a reward for miners. As the concept of miner does not exist as part of ScienceMiles, they would need to be created on a per-conference basis. We would investigate the use of smart-contract-based token systems on platforms such as Ethereum to implement this.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-20">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">4.5</span> Underlying Blockchain platform</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>ScienceMiles can be implemented on top of a public Blockchain (like Ethereum [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]), however, that would mean that every time a transaction of ScienceMiles is triggered, a fee needs to be paid to the platform, leading to the question: who pays the fee?. Alternatively, ScienceMiles can be implemented on a <em>Consortium Blockchain</em>, where the verifying nodes are run by research institutions that do so on the basis of providing a trusted environment for peer-reviewing, taking care that the size and makeup of such a consortium be diverse and large enough to maintain independence of blockchain contents and security. In this case, an interesting research question is: which permissioned-blockchain protocol is the most appropriate for the particular case of ScienceMiles?

To avoid the computational cost, and save transaction time, we would focus on adopting non-computational methods, unlike PoW (Proof of Work) [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>], for minting coins.</p>    </section>   </section>   <section id="sec-21">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>We have proposed the <em>ScienceMiles</em> model for incentivising and gamifying the process of scholarly peer-review, in order to motivate researchers to submit timely, unbiased, relevant and constructive reviews of others&#x2019; work, and to recognise and reward individual contributions to scholarly communities. In combination with an open review process, this model has the potential to make a positive difference to the academic publishing process and the quality of resulting work, and we intend to study the effects of its introduction on the review process. In future, <em>ScienceMiles</em> may go beyond the scope of research to other domains in which non-incentivised peer-reviewing takes place.</p>   </section>  </section>  <section class="back-matter">   <section id="ref-001">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2 class="page-brake-head">REFERENCES</h2>     </div>    </header>    <ul class="bibUl">     <li id="BibPLXBIB0001" label="[1]">Robert&#x00A0;E Gropp, Scott Glisson, Stephen Gallo, and Lisa Thompson. 2017.
