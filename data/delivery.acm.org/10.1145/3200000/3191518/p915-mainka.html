This possibility may lead to increased transparency and enhanced democracy. Smart Cities are not only about becoming smart by using technology but also by empowering citizens to interact with their city and in particular with their city or municipal administration. This kind of interaction is called E-participation, and it is recognized as a key factor in developing Smart Cities [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>]. Citizens create knowledge regarding their city and thus help their city and their fellow citizens to improve the city further and make it a comfortable place. Citizens interacting with the public service expect efficiency and effectiveness as well as social values [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0001">1</a>]. In this study, we are going to investigate whether smartphone applications exist to involve citizens in city&#x0027;s development, decision making, and administrative processes. As a case study, we investigate currently available apps in German municipalities and compare the offered topics, features, and usefulness of these apps.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-5">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> Method</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>The apps investigated in this paper have been found using the search engines Google and Bing. As search terms, we used the German terms &#x201C;Melde App&#x201D; (&#x201C;report app&#x201D;) and &#x201C;B&#x00FC;rger App&#x201D; (&#x201C;citizen app&#x201D;) as these are the commonly used terms for this kind of apps in Germany. We considered the result pages one to five from Bing and Google. Through this retrieval method, we only found those apps that are ranked high in the respective search engine and thus can be found by citizens easily. Searches within the Google Play Store or Apple App Store have not increased the number of identified citizen apps. The research was conducted between January 15th and 16th, 2018 and relies on the data which was available online at that time. In total, 29 mobile applications (29 Android apps, 27 also available for iOS), one web application and one community calendar were found. Further on we will only investigate the 29 apps available at least in one app store. To identify the topics and features of each application, an intellectual content investigation was needed. Accordingly, we established a coding scheme inspired by the typology and features of m-apps by Mainka et al. [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>]. The identified topics and features will be explained in the results. The data has been coded by one indexer to prevent inter-indexer inconsistency. The usefulness of apps is defined here by their spreading. Therefore the number of downloads for all apps available in the Google Play Store were considered for this purpose. The Apple App Store does not provide this information. Further metadata was retrieved to compare the app size in MB or the latest update as the external cause of the popularity of an app.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-6">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">3</span> Results</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>The apps investigated could be categorized into four topics: 1. Information Awareness, 2. City Service, 3. Transparency, and 4. Public Safety (Figure 1). One app may fall under more than one topic in this categorization schema. The most common topic of the 29 apps investigated is &#x201C;City Service&#x201D; with the subtopic &#x201C;Problem Identification&#x201D; (22 apps) which allow users to commit problems like a broken light, graffiti or a pothole. As shown in Figure 2 except for two apps it is possible for the user to add a photo (using the camera of the smartphone) and GPS position with the report. In one case it was not clearly described in the app description if the location can be added via GPS. Only in 13 cases identified problems are visualized on a map within the app and even just in nine cases the user is getting feedback on the problem resolution. Many citizen apps are developed to enhance the citizen&#x0027;s information awareness. Here we identified various subthemes that are mentioned in the app descriptions (Figure 1). 12 apps share local news, and events and 11 apps allow searching for governmental information like contact details of council members. Some apps also visualize points of interest on a city map which makes the app attractive for citizens as well as for tourists. In six cases local business information are available, and even in two cases users can inform about and book courses of the local adult education center (VHS). <figure id="fig1">     <img src="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191518/images/www18companion-257-fig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 1"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Citizen Applications categorized by Topics</span>     </div>     </figure>    </p>    <p>Local calendars are also popular in citizen apps. We found that 12 apps offer a local event calendar and nine a local garbage pick up schedule. Only in five apps, direct communication with the local municipality was offered. Three apps are also interlinked with the municipalities lost and found office which allows users to report a loss directly. Furthermore, some apps are as well developed to enhance the transparency of a municipality. Through a &#x201C;Council Information System&#x201D; citizens can inform themselves on current decision-making processes in their municipality. It offers access to the calendar of the council chamber meeting and to the current documents which are regularly updated. Finally, citizen apps may also offer push notifications on current events, weather alerts or disaster warnings. One app, called <em>Biwapp</em>, was developed only for this purpose for the whole nation and three other apps offer &#x201C;Public Safety Information&#x201D; in addition to other topics. <figure id="fig2">     <img src="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191518/images/www18companion-257-fig2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 2"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Features of Applications with the topic Problem Identification</span>     </div>     </figure>    </p>    <p>In total, 23 different software developers for citizen apps have been found through our retrieval method. In six cases the municipality has developed a new citizen app together with a software company. Seven municipalities are using an app developed by <em>styleflasher GmbH</em>, five an app by <em>Obisoft</em>, two an app by <em>komuna GmbH</em> and another two by <em>nerdgeschoss GmbH</em>. We further identified apps that are developed for a whole region like the app &#x201C;Maerker Brandenburg&#x201D; including 105 municipalities by <em>Six Offene Systeme GmbH</em>, or the app &#x201C;M&#x00E4;ngelMelder&#x201D; RLP for the federal state Rheinland Pfalz developed by <em>Innowis GmbH</em>. One app also has the approach to serve for all municipalities in Germany called &#x201C;M&#x00E4;ngelmelder Deutschland&#x201D; (&#x201C;fault notifier Germany&#x201D;) by <em>wer denkt was GmbH</em>, but it only covers 30 municipalities while the app &#x201C;B&#x00FC;rger-App City Hub&#x201D; developed by <em>Microhub GmbH</em> counts 50 municipalities. The Appendix contains the full list of developers and identified apps.</p>    <p>As listed in Table 1, the citizen apps are not downloaded very often. Mostly those apps are downloaded between 1,000 and 5,000 times in the Google Play Store which offers apps for the operating system Android. One app was downloaded between 5,000 and 10,000 times. The only purpose of this app is to offer access and to manage council information and schedules. The app is called <em>ALLRIS</em> and is available for citizens and council members as well. Considering that the app is available in 69 municipalities the number of downloads is very low. The three apps that are downloaded between 10,000 and 50,000 times have in common that they all offer the topic &#x201C;Problem Identification&#x201D;. Two apps are developed for cities: Osnabr&#x00FC;ck with a population of about 150,000 and Hamburg with a population about 1,760,000. The third app is developed for whole Germany. The apps for Osnabr&#x00FC;ck and Germany also give feedback on the &#x201C;Problem Resolution&#x201D; and visualize all reports on a map. The app for Hamburg is a service of the local city cleaning department and therefore only offers, besides, a waste calendar and further information on waste management. The two most downloaded apps are <em>Biwapp</em>, the public safety information service on the national level and <em>K&#x00F6;ln-Service App</em> a citizen app for Cologne (population about 1,047,000) that includes citizen services like a reporting system and event and waste calendars. The latter one also contains governmental information, news and event information as well as information on the local educational programme.</p>    <div class="table-responsive" id="tab1">     <div class="table-caption">     <span class="table-number">Table 1:</span>     <span class="table-title">Download numbers of Citizen Apps</span>     </div>     <table class="table">     <thead>      <tr>       <th style="text-align:left;">Downloads</th>       <th style="text-align:right;">Count</th>      </tr>     </thead>     <tbody>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:left;">50-100</td>       <td style="text-align:right;">1</td>      </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:left;">100-500</td>       <td style="text-align:right;">6</td>      </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:left;">1,000-5000</td>       <td style="text-align:right;">15</td>      </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:left;">5,000-10,000</td>       <td style="text-align:right;">1</td>      </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:left;">10,000-50,000</td>       <td style="text-align:right;">3</td>      </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:left;">50,000-10,000</td>       <td style="text-align:right;">2</td>      </tr>     </tbody>     </table>    </div>    <div class="table-responsive" id="tab2">     <div class="table-caption">     <span class="table-number">Table 2:</span>     <span class="table-title">Download numbers of Citizen Apps</span>     </div>     <table class="table">     <thead>      <tr>       <th style="text-align:center;">3c|Play Store (29 apps)</th>       <th style="text-align:center;" colspan="3">Apple App Store (24 apps with history metadata)<hr/>       </th>       <th/>       <th/>      </tr>     </thead>     <tbody>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:center;">0-6 months ago</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">6-12 months ago</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">> 12 months ago</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">0-6 months ago</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">6-12 months ago</td>       <td>> 12 months ago</td>      </tr>      <tr>       <td style="text-align:center;">17</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">7</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">5</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">15</td>       <td style="text-align:center;">7</td>       <td>2</td>      </tr>     </tbody>     </table>    </div>    <p>Metadata on the latest update of the apps are available in both app stores for Android and iOS. The Apple App Store publishes, in addition, a history of all updates and thus allows to identify the first upload of the app. But if it is the first app version than the data is not available. As shown in Table 2 the most apps are updated at least in the past six months (>06/30/17) or 12 months (>01/01/2017). Five Android apps have not been updated longer than one year. For example, the app &#x201C;Maerker Brandenburg&#x201D; which was developed for the whole federal region was updated most recently in July 2014 for Android and in November 2016 for iOS. This can also be observed for the citizen app of Wolfsburg which offers a newer version for iOS users. In two cases, the apps have been developed once but never updated again. If an app is updated does not correlate with its first development date. For instance, the &#x201C;M&#x00E4;ngelmelder Deutschland&#x201D; (report app Germany) was first published in January 2011 and recently updated in November 2017 for Android and December 2017 for iOS users. <figure id="fig3">     <img src="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3200000/3191518/images/www18companion-257-fig3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 3"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 3:</span>      <span class="figure-title">Citizen Apps assigned to Categories in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store</span>     </div>     </figure>    </p>    <p>Finally, we identified that the apps had been assigned in diverse categories regarding both app stores. In the Play Store, most citizen apps can be found in the category <em>Travel &#x0026; Local</em>. In the Apple App Store most apps are categorized under <em>News</em> and <em>Productivity</em>. However, a common categorization schema cannot be found which makes it difficult for users to search for and find those apps.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-7">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">4</span> Discussion</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>One prevalent example of a reporting app is from the US called <em>fixmystreet.com</em> which was developed as open-source project in 2011. In Germany, we could not identify any municipality using <em>fixmystreet.com</em> with our research method. In our case study, we identified diverse software developers and approaches of &#x201C;citizen apps.&#x201D; Often a running system is bought by a municipality, or they join a regional system to reduce costs. However, reports and discussions in local media highlight that the cost of smartphone applications are still a major impediment for municipalities to offer &#x201C;citizen apps.&#x201D; Looking at our results, the apps investigated have meager download rates. Taking into account that only the download numbers of Android apps are available and Android, as well as iOS, are the most used operating systems, it is unlikely that the numbers would be much higher for iOS. In Germany, participation and citizen apps are still in its infancy, and it should be investigated how citizens could be reached. Municipalities should meet the citizens&#x2019; needs or motivate them to engage [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>]. One problem is that the data generated by the citizens is not openly accessible. Looking at the citizen management system 311 in the US all data can be accessed online in a machine-readable format [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>]. Hence, to investigate the usefulness one could count the user reports and problem resolutions. Furthermore, it could be examined whether problems like graffiti or waste on streets have increased or decreased in some neighborhoods.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-8">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">5</span> Conclusions</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>The results of our case study show that there are some different participation apps mainly developed on a per city basis. Where an app covers several cities or municipalities, it is not clear which cities or municipalities these are. Thus it is hard to figure out for citizens if there is an app for their city. Diverse software companies have developed the mentioned apps, and none of these apps is an open-source app. Besides the apps not being open-source, there is no information about data handling. Citizens can use these apps to report a problem but there are not publicly visible lists of reports like it is done by <em>fixmystreet.com</em>. Transparency is essential to enhance the trust in government activities [<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>] and should be realized in those apps. The reporting lacks transparency, and furthermore it is not only unclear where the data will be sent but even more to whom the data belongs.</p>   </section>  </section>  <section class="back-matter">
