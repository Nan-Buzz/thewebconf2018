The big data arising from the digital breadcrumbs of human activities has the potential of providing a powerful social microscope, which can help us understand many complex and hidden socio-economic phenomena. Such challenge requires high-level analytics, modeling and reasoning across all the social dimensions above. There is a need to harness these opportunities for scientific advancement and for the social good, compared to the currently prevalent exploitation of big data for commercial purposes or, worse, social control and surveillance. The main obstacle to this accomplishment, besides the scarcity of data scientists, is the lack of a large-scale open ecosystem where big data and social mining research can be carried out. The SoBigData Research Infrastructure (RI) provides an integrated ecosystem for ethic-sensitive scientific discoveries and advanced applications of social data mining on the various dimensions of social life as recorded by &#x201D;big data&#x201D;. The research community uses the SoBigData facilities as a &#x201D;secure digital wind-tunnel&#x201D; for large-scale social data analysis and simulation experiments. SoBigData promotes repeatable and open science and supports data science research projects by providing: <em>i)</em> an ever-growing, distributed data ecosystem for procurement, access and curation and management of big social data, to underpin social data mining research within an ethic-sensitive context; <em>ii)</em> an ever-growing, distributed platform of interoperable, social data mining methods and associated skills: tools, methodologies and services for mining, analysing, and visualising complex and massive datasets, harnessing the techno-legal barriers to the ethically safe deployment of big data for social mining; <em>iii)</em> an ecosystem where protection of personal information and the respect for fundamental human rights can coexist with a safe use of the same information for scientific purposes of broad and central societal interest. SoBigData has a dedicated ethical and legal board, which is implementing a legal and ethical framework.</small>     </p>    </div>    <div class="CCSconcepts">     <p> <small> <span style="font-weight:bold;">CCS Concepts:</span> &#x2022;<strong> Information systems </strong>&#x2192; <em>Information systems applications;</em></small> </p>    </div>    <div class="classifications">     <div class="author">     <span style="font-weight:bold;">      <small>Keywords:</small>     </span>     <span class="keyword">      <small>European Project; Social Mining; Social Data; Ethics; Big Data</small>     </span>     </div>     <br/>     <div class="AcmReferenceFormat">     <p>      <small>       <span style="font-weight:bold;">ACM Reference Format:</span>       <br/>       Fosca Giannotti, Roberto Trasarti, Kalina Bontcheva, and Valerio Grossi. 2018.

The project is creating a new European e-infrastructure that comprises virtual research environments for data scientists, large datasets in unified format, and hundreds of distributed, interoperable analytics and visualisation services, accessible through common interfaces. SoBigData builds on expertise and recent advances in e-Infra-structures, relevant European data infrastructures, and seven established national infrastructures and data centers organized in the following six thematic clusters arising from different research fields of social mining and big data analytics (text and social media mining - TSMM; social network analysis - SNA; human mobility analytics - HMA; web analytics - WA; visual analytics - VA; and social data - SD). The following national infrastructures are integrated: <figure id="fig1">     <img src="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186205/images/www18companion-58-fig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 1"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span>      <span class="figure-title">SoBigData resources and access opportunities.</span>     </div>     </figure>     <strong>SoBigData.it</strong>, the knowledge infrastructure of the European Laboratory on Big Data Analytics and Social Mining, funded by two institutes of CNR and the University of Pisa, offering data, services and expertise on TSMM, SNA, HMA, WA.</p>    <p>     <strong>GATE Cloud</strong>, the cloud-based infrastructure for large-scale natural language processing and text mining at the University of Sheffield, offering data, services and expertise on TSMM.</p>    <p>     <strong>IVAS</strong>, the server-based infrastructure for Information Visualization and Visual Analytics at the Fraunhofer competence centre, offering data, services and expertise on VA. Alexandria, the infrastructure for Web Science at Leibniz Universitaet, offering data, services and expertise on WA.</p>    <p>     <strong>AALTO</strong>, the Sociophysics and Data Mining laboratories at Aalto University in Helsinki, offering data, services and competences on SNA.</p>    <p>     <strong>E-Gov.data</strong>, the centre at University of Tartu curating the Estonian e-government and e-health data, offering access and services to these unique dataset over 10 years (SD).</p>    <p>     <strong>Living Archive for Open Data</strong>, a search engine for Open Data offered by the Department of Sociology at ETH Zurich (SD).</p>    <p>SoBigData has a strong ethical motivation. We are building an ecosystem where protection of personal information and the respect for fundamental human rights coexist with a safe use of the same information for scientific purposes of broad and central societal interest. Extreme care is taken in all parts of the project and among all consortium partners not only to guarantee compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and codes of conduct, but also to prevent unethical outcomes of the envisaged cutting edge research and applications by ongoing analysis of the moral problems that pose constant challenges for law, regulation and governance of information technology. SoBigData pursues the views that EU is developing on Responsible Research and Innovation, and it operationalizes the values that drive the ongoing reform of the EU Data Protection legislation. SoBigData RI manages vertical, thematic environments, called exploratories, on top of the SoBigData infrastructures, to perform cross-disciplinary social mining research: <strong>City of Citizens</strong>: this exploratory tells stories about cities and people living in it. We describe those territories by means of data, statistics and models.</p>    <p>     <strong>Well-being &#x0026; Economy</strong>: can Big Data help us to understand relationships between economy and daily life habits? We use data of purchases in supermarkets and investigate people&#x0027;s behavior.</p>    <p>     <strong>Societal Debates</strong>: this exploratory studies public debates on social media and newspaper. It identifies themes, following the discussions around them and tracking them through time and space.</p>    <p>     <strong>Migration Studies</strong>: could Big Data help to understand the migration phenomenon? We try to answer to some questions about migrations in Europe and in the world.</p>    <p>     <strong>Sports Data Science</strong>: this exploratory tells stories about sports analytics. Sports data scientists describe performances by means of data, statistics and models. This allows coaches, fans and practitioners to better understand and boost sports performance. <figure id="fig2">     <img src="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3186205/images/www18companion-58-fig2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figure 2"       longdesc=""/>     <div class="figure-caption">      <span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span>      <span class="figure-title">SoBigData Project organization.</span>     </div>     </figure>    </p>    <p>Currently (January 2018) SoBigData contains more than 120 resources including methods and datasets published in its platform and the number is growing thanks to the collaboration between the original partners and new organizations and users.
