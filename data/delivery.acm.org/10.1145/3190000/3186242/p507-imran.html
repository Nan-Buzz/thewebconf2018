In particular, immediately after sudden-onset events, when information is most needed, information may be scarce.</p>    <p>The growing adaption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and social networking platforms such as Twitter and Facebook has created numerous opportunities to disseminate and consume time-critical information in the form of images, videos and textual messages during natural disasters and emergencies&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0047">47</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0049">49</a>]. Social media postings are useful for a number of crisis response and management tasks such as: gaining insights into the situation as it unfolds, identifying urgent needs of the affected communities, and assessing the severity of damage&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0008">8</a>]. Hence, many formal disaster response or emergency management organizations are interested in finding ways to quickly and easily locate and organize the information that is most useful to them&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0048">48</a>].</p>    <p>However, the time-critical analysis of high-velocity, high-volume social media streams involves solving multiple challenges, including real-time parsing of brief and informal messages, handling information overload, determining information credibility, and prioritizing useful information. These challenges can be mapped to classical information processing tasks such as filtering, classifying, extracting, aggregating, ranking, visualizing, and summarizing information. For example, automatic classification techniques help reduce information overload by filtering out irrelevant messages, and summarization techniques help gain situational awareness by extracting important summaries from the relevant messages.</p>    <p>In addition to the textual content of social media, multimedia content (images and videos) can be valuable for disaster response and management&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0036">36</a>]. For instance, images posted can be used to evaluate the severity of damage to critical infrastructure such as buildings, bridges, and roads&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>]. Furthermore, in areas without Internet access, satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can collect imagery data to increase situational awareness&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0034">34</a>]. However, in contrast to the main advances in text processing (e.g., natural language processing) techniques, less has been done for multimedia content processing.</p>    <p>This paper summarizes an extended survey&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"     href="#BibPLXBIB0018">18</a>] covering state of the art methods for processing social media to support various disaster response and management operations. We further include new research questions and challenges for social media information processing in crisis response.</p>   </section>   <section id="sec-6">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">2</span> Information needs, Data Characteristics, and Acquisition</h2>     </div>    </header>    <section id="sec-7">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.1</span> Information needs</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>The information needs of formal emergency response organizations varies with their roles and duties, as well as with characteristics of their specific context and its evolution over time&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0015">15</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0016">16</a>]. For instance, humanitarian and governmental emergency management organizations seek high-level information about a disaster, such as the scale of the event, the number of people living in the affected areas, and the overall economic impact. In contrast, organizations such as local police forces and firefighters benefit from information concerning individual emergency cases, such as urgent medical emergency reports, and the location of severely injured or trapped people. Roughly, these two types can be characterized as seeking to understand &#x201C;the big picture&#x201D; versus finding &#x201C;actionable insights.&#x201D;</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-8">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.2</span> Data characteristics and acquisition</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>The factors that can trigger an increase in social media communications can be endogenous or exogenous. The former includes spontaneous popularity increases of an information &#x201C;meme&#x201D; due to information cascades or contagion. The latter includes large-scale events such as disasters, emergencies, and mass convergence events. Data quality, in terms of readability, grammar, and sentence structure, vary significantly across social media platforms. For instance, messages in Twitter are often brief, informal, unstructured, and contain grammar and spelling mistakes. Preprocessing this data is an essential step before it can be used for any computation.</p>     <p>For automatic data collection, most large social media platforms provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Generally, these APIs can be categorized into two types: search APIs and streaming APIs. Search APIs provide access to archived messages up to a certain limit. Streaming APIs allow subscribers to continuously consume data from a real-time data feed (again data limits maybe imposed). Different data collection strategies can be used to collect data, depending on the information need expressiveness allowed on these APIs. For example, a geographical rectangle (or bounding box) can be defined to acquire geo-tagged messages, a boolean query composed of keywords can be defined to acquire messages matching such query, or a specific set of users can be specified to collect everything those users post.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-9">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.3</span> Event detection</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>Social media data processing systems often start with the automatic detection of an event. Crisis situations can be expected (i.e., predicted or forewarned) or unexpected. Expected crises include extreme weather events such as storms and tornadoes, where information is usually broadcast publicly before the event happens. Unexpected events include earthquakes and technological disasters such as industrial accidents, which can be anticipated only to a very coarse degree. The Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) research community has developed techniques based on data from news media and other sources&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0003">3</a>] including story segmentation, topic detection, new event detection&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0005">5</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0040">40</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0041">41</a>], link detection, and topic tracking&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0045">45</a>]. A popular approach to detect new events in a data stream is to look for sudden increases in the frequency (&#x201C;bursts&#x201D;) of sets of keywords. However, this approach has some shortcomings. For instance, many popular hashtags (such as #followfriday) do not represent real-world events. Other approaches include using wavelet-based clustering of frequency signals, topic clustering with meta-data analysis, and domain-specific approaches using predetermined rules&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0012">12</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0050">50</a>].</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-10">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">2.4</span> Retrospective versus live data processing</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>Once an event is detected, its continuous tracking to obtain real-time insights is important for crisis responders. To be effective during emergencies, the data should be processed in real-time, and not retrospectively. Live data analysis (online processing) is usually performed over a current stream of data relevant for an event, often provided in real-time or with a short delay. The trade-off between retrospective and real-time data analysis is a matter of accuracy versus latency. However, in time-critical situations, the urgency with which the output of an analysis is required remains high, thus online algorithms using stream processing architectures can play a vital role&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0028">28</a>].</p>    </section>   </section>   <section id="sec-11">    <header>     <div class="title-info">     <h2>      <span class="section-number">3</span> Classification, Clustering, and Summarization</h2>     </div>    </header>    <p>Social media communications during disasters are now so abundant that it is necessary to sift through hundreds of thousands, even millions of data points to find useful information.

One well-known approach to this task is supervised classification, which requires labeled examples (usually thousands of them). The selection of the set of categories to be used is mainly driven by two main factors: the data that is present in social media during crises and the information needs of users&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>].</p>     <p>A classification task broadly includes different typologies of messages <em>by information provided</em> (e.g., affected or injured people, infrastructure damage, urgent needs of affected population)&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0019">19</a>], or <em>by information source</em> (e.g., eyewitness accounts, official government sources, TV, radio)&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0035">35</a>], or <em>by information credibility factors</em> (e.g., fake news, rumors, disinformation, misinformation)&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>], or <em>by temporal aspects</em> (e.g., using different temporal phases of an event including pre, during, and post)&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0011">11</a>], <em>by geographical locations</em> (e.g., based on particular geographical area or places near to the disaster zone), or <em>by factual, subjective, or emotional content</em>.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-13">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">3.2</span> Information clustering</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>Clustering, which is an unsupervised machine-learning technique, covers a family of methods that seek to identify and explain important hidden patterns in unlabeled data. To process social media data during crises, clustering can help gather semantically similar messages that need to be processed/examined by humans, for instance by displaying multiple equivalent messages as a single item instead of multiple ones&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0006">6</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0042">42</a>]. Clustering approaches can be used to find anomalies in crisis data streams and to discover human annotation errors to improve the quality of supervised classification process&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0017">17</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0020">20</a>].</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-14">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">3.3</span> Information summarization</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>Categorizing messages reduces the amount of information that has to be processed by humans, but the remaining set of messages, even in single categories, can still be overwhelming for crisis responders. Information summarization techniques generate text-based summaries of an event as it unfolds. Text summarization systems are usually designed to surface core topics discussed in a set of relevant documents by locating key sentences. Other systems can produce a summary by abstracting or generating new sentences&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0004">4</a>].</p>     <p>In the context of disaster data summarization, temporal information summarization or update summarization methods can infer the importance of different sentences using disaster-specific features, including geo-location and language models representing the way in which people write in social media about a disaster&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0024">24</a>].

Other approaches adapt a two-step approach in which first critical sub-events are identified and then summarized&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0043">43</a>]</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-15">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">3.4</span> Information veracity</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>While social media can be a valuable resource for crisis response efforts, one of the barriers that hinders its use as a resource is the lack of trust on its contents&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0014">14</a>]. Determining information credibility is difficult, especially during an ongoing emergency situation, as it involves dealing with misinformation (unintentional), disinformation (intentional), and rumors (unverifiable). Automatic techniques have been proposed to determine information credibility on social media, most such methods are based on superficial characteristics of the messages and of the history of the users who post them&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0009">9</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0039">39</a>].</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-16">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">3.5</span> Semantic enrichment</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>Semantic enrichment can be used to add layers of semantics (e.g., meta-data) to information so that algorithms can understand and interpret its meaning. Named entity recognition is a well-known semantic enrichment technique useful to identify named entities (person, places, and organization) from a give piece of information (e.g., a tweet). The identified named entities can then be linked to concepts (in many cases real-world concepts). After named-entity linking, messages that have been semantically enriched can be used to provide faceted search, a popular approach to interactively search through complex information spaces. Such semantic techniques have been used in social media processing systems e.g., <em>Twitris</em>&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0038">38</a>].</p>     <p>Automatic processing systems interact with each other for a variety of reasons, allowing users to engage in information &#x201C;triangulation.&#x201D; However, allowing systems to communicate information in a unified way is a challenging endeavor. An effective way to enable such heterogeneous communications is through machine-understandable ontologies. In crisis informatics domain ontologies such as HXL&#x00A0;<a class="fn" href="#fn2" id="foot-fn2"><sup>1</sup></a>, MOAC&#x00A0;<a class="fn" href="#fn3" id="foot-fn3"><sup>2</sup></a> define and categorize different concepts to facilitate a common understanding.</p>    </section>    <section id="sec-17">     <header>     <div class="title-info">      <h3>       <span class="section-number">3.6</span> Multimedia processing</h3>     </div>     </header>     <p>Despite the wealth of research studies on the processing of social media textual content, comparatively less has been done on multimedia (images and videos) content.

Additionally, messages containing images/photos have been found to be more helpful for other tasks such as estimating the epicenter of an earthquake&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0025">25</a>].</p>     <p>Other approaches combine features from textual and imagery content to, for example, classify visually relevant and irrelevant tweets&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0010">10</a>, <a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0051">51</a>] or to generate event timelines using image-text summarization&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0051">51</a>]. Visual summaries of trending topics can be generated using a multimodal-LDA (MMLDA) method&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0007">7</a>], and image classification can be used to support a number of crisis response tasks&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0002">2</a>] such as critical infrastructure damage assessment&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0033">33</a>] and irrelevant image filtering&#x00A0;[<a class="bib" data-trigger="hover" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"      href="#BibPLXBIB0030">30</a>].</p>     <p>Satellite imagery and aerial imagery captured via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is increasingly considered important and useful for disaster response.

Online learning helps models dynamically adapt to new changes and patterns in the data.

Moreover, presence of duplicate messages in the training and testing sets may lead to misleading measurements of accuracy. Possible solutions include, for example, having an aggressive de-duplication strategy and employing an <em>active learning</em> technique to help select messages that are most likely to increase a system&#x0027;s accuracy.

Techniques that try to tackle this issue should consider different factors such as what is the evidence?
